<p><strong>TLDR: WATCH THE VIDEO (click above)</strong></p><p>Imagine your monthly power bill showing not just <em>your</em> energy consumption, but also how it stacks up against your neighbors'. The classic <a href="https://www.povertyactionlab.org/evaluation/opower-evaluating-impact-home-energy-reports-energy-conservation-united-states">Opower study</a> did just this, and the results are a lesson in how <strong>peer comparison </strong>can spark behavior change: a 2% reduction in energy usage across 600,000 homes. It might sound small, but the implications are huge.</p><p>While most people understand the concept of &#8216;social proof&#8217;, implementing it successfully is an art. There are so many ways <strong>social proof can backfire</strong>. Do you have the right reference group? Is the benchmark too high?&nbsp;&#128207;</p><p>In today&#8217;s teardown, I log into my Opower to unpack <strong>how social norms impact user behavior</strong>. I explore <strong>benchmarking</strong> and <strong>goal gradients</strong> in product design, surfacing questions like:</p><p>&#128161; How high should you set the bar? <br>&#128161; Can high benchmarks <em>decrease</em> our motivation?&nbsp;<br>&#128161; And most importantly, how can these insights be skillfully applied to design products that change behavior for good (including lowering my energy consumption!)? &#128578;</p><p>There&#8217;s also a twist: Opower is now comparing me not to other users, but to my own past usage. Can a &#8216;<strong>me against me</strong>&#8217; strategy work as well as classic peer comparison?</p><p>One key takeaway: <strong>context matters</strong> in behavioral interventions. Opower's approach is nuanced. Behavior change isn&#8217;t just about the method, but also how easy or hard the actions required are. &#9757;&#65039;</p><p><strong>3 themes from this teardown:</strong></p><p>&#128207; How <strong>peer comparison</strong> drives user engagement<br>&#129349; The subtle art of setting <strong>attainable goals </strong>that motivate and retain users&nbsp;<br>&#129697; How to tailor strategies to <strong>different user contexts</strong> for maximum impact</p><p>I left my Opower dissection with a fresh appreciation of how <strong>subtle aspects of product design</strong> can significantly impact user behavior. I&#8217;m betting you will, too.</p><p>Back next week with another high-energy teardown! &#9889;&#65039;</p><div class="native-video-embed" data-component-name="VideoPlaceholder" data-attrs="{&quot;mediaUploadId&quot;:&quot;05b8ad05-2866-4f5f-90b0-e8eb5298cd76&quot;,&quot;duration&quot;:null}"></div><p><em><strong>Have a friend who would enjoy these teardowns?
