<p>Each year, I post a reader survey. This helps me learn who&#8217;s reading this blog. But it also helps me try to replicate a bunch of psych findings, and investigate interesting hypotheses. Some highlights from past years include <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/01/08/fight-me-psychologists-birth-order-effects-exist-and-are-very-strong/">birth order effects</a>, <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/01/15/kernel-of-doubt-testing-math-preference-vs-corn-eating-style/">mathematical interests vs. corn-eating style</a>, <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/04/17/ssc-survey-results-sexual-harassment-levels-by-field/">sexual harassment victimization rates in different fields</a>, <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/01/28/assortative-mating-and-autism/">whether all our kids are going to have autism</a>, and <a href="https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/crowds-are-wise-and-ones-a-crowd">wisdom of inner crowds</a>.</p><p>This year&#8217;s survey will probably take 15 - 30 minutes (source: it took me 10 minutes, but I knew all the questions beforehand, so it might take other people longer). As an incentive to go through this, I&#8217;ll give free one-year paid subscriptions to five randomly-selected survey respondents. The survey will be open until about April 10, so try to take it before then.</p><p><strong><a href="https://forms.gle/4JnQV2MwQrNgLgGBA">Click here to take the survey.</a></strong> If you notice any problems, please ask yourself <em>&#8220;Is this a real objection rather than a nitpick? Is there a single person in the world who will genuinely be confused/upset with this wording?&#8221;</em> - and if the answer is yes, comment here so I can fix it.</p>
