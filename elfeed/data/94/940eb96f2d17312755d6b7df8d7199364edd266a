Here&#8217;s <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/noah-smiths-writing-advice">my writing advice</a>, my advice for creating a <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/how-to-write-a-successful-substack">successful Substack-type newsletter</a>, and some thoughts on <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/how-to-be-an-opinion-writer">how to add value</a> as an opinion writer/pundit/commentator. This year&#8217;s post is about some big advantages that independent op-ed writers like myself have over those who write for publications. </p><p>I&#8217;ve been blogging independently since 2011, but for most of my years as a paid op-ed writer, I wrote for online publications. First I freelanced for The Atlantic, Quartz, Bloomberg Opinion, and The Week for a couple of years, and then I became a full-time writer at Bloomberg Opinion (though I was still counted as a contract employee, which allowed me to do side jobs). </p><p>I enjoyed writing for Bloomberg, but writing for Substack is a lot better. It&#8217;s brought me a <em>much</em> bigger readership, for one thing &#8212; each post now gets read by about three times as many people as before. A lot of that is because of the magic of email distribution; I didn&#8217;t have my own newsletter until now. But I&#8217;ve also just been able to put out a lot <em>more</em> content on Substack than I did for Bloomberg &#8212; and in my personal opinion (and the opinions of many readers), it&#8217;s higher-quality content as well. As for whether I&#8217;m generating more subscription revenue for myself now than I did for Bloomberg back then, I can&#8217;t say; they didn&#8217;t let me see those statistics (and they probably couldn&#8217;t separate out each writer&#8217;s contribution, either). But I would bet that I am.</p><p>Independent op-ed writers are certainly at a disadvantage in some respects. They have to do all their own marketing, and they don&#8217;t automatically get their columns in front of a big existing readership. Instead of earning a steady salary, they have to cope with income volatility as subscriptions go up and down. But they have one huge advantage over op-ed writers at publications: <strong>They don&#8217;t have editors.</strong></p><p>It may come as a surprise to hear that I think this is a big advantage. Usually, &#8220;such-and-such doesn&#8217;t have an editor&#8221; is used as an insult, meaning that a writer is too verbose or disorganized. But after having written with and without an editor, and having watched other writers do both, it&#8217;s my considered opinion that <strong>editors generally subtract value from the opinion writing process</strong>.</p><p>Before I explain the (many) reasons why I believe this, I should issue a couple of qualifiers. First of all, I&#8217;m only talking about the value of editing for <em>op-ed writers</em>, not for <em>reporters</em>. News journalism &#8212; reporting original facts by quoting sources &#8212; is something I&#8217;ve never done, and it seems like much more of a team exercise than op-ed writing. Editors seem like they play a useful role in determining the appropriate tone for reporting, maintaining objectivity, etc. They help reporters decide which sources are reliable and which aren&#8217;t. And they also play a critical role in assigning reporters to beats, so they don&#8217;t all report on the same thing. Throughout this post, I&#8217;ll keep coming back to the differences between reporting and op-ed writing.</p><p>Second, what I&#8217;m saying applies to <em>most</em> op-ed writers, but not to <em>all</em> of them. There are some independent newsletter writers who employ professional editors to edit every post they put out, and I defer to their judgement. It&#8217;s not hard to imagine some writers who are great at most of the tasks involved, but just persistently bad at one or two of them &#8212; for example, a writer who&#8217;s great at writing paragraphs but simply terrible at organizing them into a coherent flow. An editor can fill that gap.</p><p>But I think that <em>most</em> op-ed writers &#8212; or at least, most good ones &#8212; would thrive and flourish without editors. And most digital publications could save a lot of money by letting their op-ed writers work without editors; this could help a lot of publications survive in an increasingly competitive content marketplace.</p><p>Let me explain why I think this. </p><h4>Editors prevent writers from finding product-market fit</h4>
