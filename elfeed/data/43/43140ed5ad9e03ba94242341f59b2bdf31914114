<p>“I became so avid a collector of instances of bad judgment that I paid no attention to boundaries between professional territories … why should I search for some tiny, unimportant, hard-to-find new stupidity in my own field when some large, important, easy-to-find stupidity was just over the fence in the other fellow’s professional territory? – Munger</p>
