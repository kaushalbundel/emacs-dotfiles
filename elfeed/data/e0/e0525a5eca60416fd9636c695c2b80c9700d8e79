<p>This is an excerpt from my journal.</p>

<hr />

<p>I started blogging in 2010 before I eventually set up my website the
following year.  At the time I was a university student.  I wrote
about politics, the field of my studies.  The first blogs I set up
were toy projects to learn about the platform, experiment with
different layouts, and the like.  Once I had a good idea of what I was
doing, I created a private blog for me and my classmates, thinking it
would be fruitful for us to have a shared space to record our thoughts
in written form and exchange comments about them.</p>

<p>What motivated me to pursue such an initiative was the belief that my
enthusiasm to speak my mind through the pages of a website was shared
among my peers.  I quickly learnt this was not the case.  Being
situationally related to others does not necessarily mean you have
overlapping interests.  I was the only one in my group who wrote
extensively and who cared about blogging.</p>

<p>The realisation was a moment of crisis, of judging how things stand
and of making a decision with far-reaching implications.  I questioned
whether I wanted to be part of the group and behave the way they did,
or heed the inner voice and pursue my intellectual curiosity despite
the groups wishes, be they overt or tacit.  “Why do I write?” I asked
myself.  It was not about making friends: I already had them.  It was
not about being popular: popularity in a small group of equals is
irrelevant.  Writing was a personal affair, springing from within and
requiring an outlet to be made manifest.</p>

<p>I was hesitant to start a personal website.  There was nobody to tell
me if I was on the right path and whether what I was doing was
worthwhile.  Plus, I was a Bachelor’s student and it would be odd for
someone of my status at the time to opine on highly technical matters.
That is for experts to handle, no?  People tend to have this
self-limiting belief that unless they are the best in the given field,
they are nothing.  To me this always felt odd.  If I am not good
enough, others will be able to tell as much, and for as long as I am
not seeking to deceive anyone, I will fearlessly express my thoughts.
If others fail to recognise my ignorance, it is their problem, not
mine.  Still, not receiving any feedback was concerning.  It made me
question my judgement and meditate carefully about my next steps.  “Do
I seek validation?” I wondered, answering in the negative and
venturing into the unknown.  My inclination to write and to think
things through found fulfilment in public writing.  I was content with
what I was doing, despite the absence of constructive commentary from
those in my milieu.</p>

<p>What if I had conformed with the behavioural patterns of the group and
refrained from ever publishing anything?  Would it not be more prudent
for a student to know their place?  Norms never felt compelling to me
qua norms without being backed by cogent arguments.  What is wrong
with a student participating in a public discussion?  Let me be an
ignoramus and deal with the consequences of my ignorance.  I feel I
would have lived with regrets, with self-contempt for yielding to
heteronomy and the inertia it entailed in this case in exchange for
conformity, i.e.  the simulacrum of comfort.  Instead, I did what gave
meaning to my life, what my condition rendered necessary for my
continued commitment to the work I was destined to do.</p>

<p>It is common nowadays to sound smart by dismissing the notion of
“destiny” as some ancient superstition.  Perhaps many of the
narratives around the concept are indeed wrong and misleading, though
the core tenet of not everything being in the person’s control seems
relevant to me.  I did not choose the set of talents I was endowed
with, just as I had no input in how those would be combined with my
personality and appearance as well as my particular upbringing, all of
which contribute to how I conduct myself and am perceived by others.
Give it whatever name you want, such as “genes” or “environment”,
though the point is that factors beyond—and prior—to me contribute
to state of affairs whose specifics and parametric aspects remain
outside the purview of my volition.</p>

<p>I had to write.  It was not a matter of choice, although it appeared
as much, but of realising my potential.  The plant must grow roots
deeper into the ground.  The bird shall fly to distant in search for
temperate climates, and so will the human answer the inner call and
echo, as it were, the voice of the muses.</p>

<p>I am reminded of those moments now that I live in the hut.  Someone
gave me advice to not build here because no-one will like what I am
doing.  Who is this “no-one”, anyway, and what is my relationship with
them?  I politely listened and ultimately did what I had to do.  Other
people’s opinion matters only when they understand you in light of the
particularities of the case and have genuine insight to share.  Many
will be quick to share their thoughts without evaluating the
prevailing conditions and with no effort whatsoever to understand who
the person is in the specifics of the situation.  They have no bad
intentions, though they can still do harm if the person has not yet
developed the requisite resolve to not seek validation from others for
matters that are self-contained.</p>

<p>It does not matter if folks will like where I live and approve of how
I do it, because they are withdrawn from these experiences as well as
the drivers behind them.  They cannot relate.  Yet even if they can,
their views are, at best, an assessment of how they would tolerate
such conditions, not how I can cope with them.  Each person is
different: what is tolerable for me, is living hell for another.  More
importantly though, the person with a powerful motivation to act is
willing to go to lengths that are otherwise too far away to fathom.</p>

<p>Should we thus not listen to others?  No!  We do not have all the
answers and many erroneous ideas we entertain are not apparently false
to us due of how attached we are to them.  I think we must carefully
assess whether the matter is personal or not.  If I blog or not is of
no import to those around me.  Same for strictly in-house matters,
such as if I have heating and warm water at the hut or not: they only
affects me.  If someone does not like cold showers, I see no problem
in them increasing the water’s temperature.  Life is simple this way.
Perhaps then, the safest generalisation is to act decisively once you
have concluded that no harm will be caused to anyone as a direct
consequence of your actions.</p>

<p>The problem, however, is that no rule can ever be formulated in such a
way as to cover all possible scenaria.  There will be exceptions,
meaning that we will always have to exercise judgement.  It is why
Athena, the goddess of wisdom, is represented as a hoplite, wielding a
shield and a spear.  Sometimes—sometimes!—the wisest course of
action is to rise up to the occasion and fight.  Sometimes!  When
exactly?  That takes wisdom.</p>
