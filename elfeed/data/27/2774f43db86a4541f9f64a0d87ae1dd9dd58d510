We stayed an extra day in Portland to do some site seeing. I&#39;ll write
about the tourist side in my final SIGCSE2024 post. Right now, we&#39;re
back in the hotel resting before dinner so I thought I&#39;d start the
next part of my SIGCSE2024 report.</p>
<p>
For Day one&#39;s first session, I attended <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lewiscolleen/">Colleen Lewis&#39;s</a> Microteaching
session. I&#39;ve wrote about this session <a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/post/sigcse-2023-microteaching/">last year</a> and also about
Colleen&#39;s recent appearance on the CSEd podcast where she discussed
<a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/post/manipulatives/">manipulatives.</a> Much of Colleen&#39;s public facing work involves CS
pedagogy and if you haven&#39;t noticed, I&#39;m a fan.</p>
<p>
Microteaching has fast become my favorite SIGCSE session. Six teachers
each give a quick, abbreviated mini-lesson and afterwards Colleen
highlights pedagogical techniques.</p>
<p>
It&#39;s not perfect. The mini-lessons are taught out of context, the
audience aren&#39;t the presenters real classes, and it&#39;s only something
like a 10 minute snippet but still, it made for a great session.</p>
<p>
In one mini-lesson, Colleen pointed out that the presenter gave the
&#34;class&#34; (us) time to process a question before asking for
responses. Questioning technique and timing is an important part of
K12 teacher training and I&#39;m betting it&#39;s not covered nearly enough at
the college level. There&#39;s a huge amount to explore on questioning but
a simple technique like this - waiting say, 10 seconds after asking a
question before entertaining a response can be huge.</p>
<p>
In another lesson, Colleen commented how the teacher provided to
concrete but different examples to set the stage for a class
exercise. I liked that particular lesson, delivered by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adam-blank-707669245/">Adam Blank</a>
because it wasn&#39;t a core lesson in his class but rather a fun side
topic to set the stage for the cybersecurity work yet to come. He
elicited suggestions from the class how they could first crack a safe
(using the typical movie trope of listening with a stethoscope) and
how to crack a keypad lock by looking at the worn out keys on the
keypad. This led to a class &#34;lab&#34; where we had to figure out which
mystery toy was in an egg shell without opening it. All of this was to
teach the class about side channel attacks. It was terrific.</p>
<p>
This went on for six mini-lessons in all.</p>
<p>
It was a great session but I had one thought that might make it
better. Instead of six mini-lessons, how about only three so that we&#39;d
then have time to discuss the lessons. This could be tricky because it
puts the people presenting on the spot and open to criticism but it
could be <strong>so</strong> valuable.</p>
<p>
For example, in one of the mini-lessons, the instructor presented a
binary tree. Each node had a student name on it and also a priority
value.Later the teacher removed the names. Colleen highlighted that
putting the name in to the tree (along with priority values) was a
strong technique as was later removing them. I partially agreed with
this but also felt that removing the names could also have weakened
the lesson. We didn&#39;t have full context so I can&#39;t be sure. In any
event, this could have led to some really rich discussion.</p>
<p>
A second example, and one I loved was when one teacher engaged the
&#34;class&#34; prior to the lesson. He asked a student their future plans and
after an exchange invited the student to come to office hours to
discuss. This was a great example of a hidden technique for a number
of reasons. One reason in particular I&#39;ll address when I talk about
the other SIGCSE keynotes but it&#39;s also a technique that can be a
negative. On the plus side it&#39;s a way to engage the class at a more
informal manner, it can be used to build class community and culture,
and also, if it&#39;s a morning class, start to get sleep minds stirring
(not to mention the plus I&#39;ll talk about later). On the other hand, if
you do this consistently with just a couple of students, you risk
building resentment or concern from the students that aren&#39;t part of
the &#34;in crowd.&#34;</p>
<p>
All in all, a super session that gave attendees a chance to
see aspects of teaching that are never covered in research papers and
rarely talked about in general. Looking forward to next year&#39;s
edition.</p>
<p>
I think I&#39;ll organize the rest of my SIGCSE report into session
types - BOFs, paper sessions, and panels so stay tuned for more.</p>
