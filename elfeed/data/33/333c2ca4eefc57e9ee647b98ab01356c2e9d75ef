<p><strong>The video will be recorded and can be watched later.</strong>  I will do
some work on my Denote package and maybe tackle other Emacs-related
issues.  I plan to make this about 2 hours long, though we will see in
practice.</p>

<h2>About Denote</h2>

<p>Denote is a simple note-taking tool for Emacs.  It is based on the
idea that notes should follow a predictable and descriptive
file-naming scheme.  The file name must offer a clear indication of
what the note is about, without reference to any other metadata.
Denote basically streamlines the creation of such files while
providing facilities to link between them.</p>

<p>Denote’s file-naming scheme is not limited to “notes”.  It can be used
for all types of file, including those that are not editable in Emacs,
such as videos.  Naming files in a consistent way makes their
filtering and retrieval considerably easier.  Denote provides relevant
facilities to rename files, regardless of file type.</p>
