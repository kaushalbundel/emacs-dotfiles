<p class="p1">As announced by Yahoo! this morning, I have been asked and agreed to join its Board of Directors. It is an honor to be asked, in and of itself. There are three key reasons I accepted:  </p>
<p class="p2">Personal: I&rsquo;ve long respected Marissa&rsquo;s talent and tenacity. Her decision to take the top role at Yahoo! was a very ballsy move, and when she asked for my help, I was excited about working with her. </p>
<p class="p2">Business: a stronger, fast-growing  Yahoo!, with its tremendous resources is a massive net-positive for the Silicon Valley ecosystem, the market in general, and the US economy. </p>
<p class="p2">Sentimental: Yahoo! was one of the first true giants created by this amazing new thing, the Web. Before Google or Facebook, before almost everything  there was Jerry&rsquo;s Guide, right up there with What&rsquo;s New page in Mosaic. Through amazing luck, I was a Computer Science freshman at UIUC in &lsquo;93, which gave me a glimpse into the fantastic future we are now living. Yahoo! showed me that computer geeks can start companies that create that future. I&rsquo;d love to do my part in helping the company that inspired me. </p>
