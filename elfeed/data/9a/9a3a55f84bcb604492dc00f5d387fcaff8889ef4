We started day 2 with a walking tour. We&#39;ve been using <a href="https://freetoursbyfoot.com/">Free Tours by
Foot</a> or similar services. No fee or a small reservation fee up front
and then pay what you want at the end. We generally haven&#39;t been
disappointed and also generally end up tipping voluntarily about the
same amount as what we&#39;d pay for a pay up front tour.</p>
<p>
We walked around downtown getting more local and US history and
learning about the city. During one stop at the <a href="https://charlestonstage.com/about-us/dock-street-theatre">Dock Street Theater</a> we
learned about Charleston&#39;s preservation and architectural restoration
efforts.</p>

<p>
We also discussed Charleston&#39;s history of religious tolerance, being
known as the Holy City due to the preponderance of churches and
acceptance of all religions. </p>

<p>
We also got to see a whole lot of wrought iron created by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Simmons">Philip
Simmons</a>.</p>

<p>
After lunch, Devorah and I visited <a href="https://www.kkbe.org/">KKBE</a> - America&#39;s first reform
Jewish congregation. They give an interesting tour. Jews started
appearing in Charleston in the late sixteen, early seventeen
hundreds. They were of Sephardic descent. This was similar to the
first Jews in New Amsterdam who came for religious tolerance (but as a
New Yorker, I have to say that they got to us first :-) ). The first
reformers from Germany came to Charleston in the 1820s and KKBE, the
first Reform Congreation in America was formed in 1841.</p>

<p>
This is interesting for two reasons. First, this congregation,
according to our docent didn&#39;t specifically follow the lead of the
reform movement in Germany. Second, Isaac Mayer Wise is normally
credited with starting the Reform Judaism movement in America when he
settled in Albany in 1846, some five years later.</p>
<p>
After the tour, we walked around, saw this storefront:</p>

<p>
Neither of us knew what the old Kress building was, now housing an H&amp;M
but Devorah and I both thought &#34;Damn, they were Scribnered&#34; (if you
know, you know).</p>
<p>
It turns out that S.H Kress owned a series of &#34;five and dime&#34; stores
and one was in this building. The store there was the cite of a noted
civil rights protest. </p>
<p>
We also saw some fountains in public parks including of course, the
Pineapple Fountain.</p>

<p>
We ended the day passing the historic marker commemorating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Smalls">Robert
Smalls</a>. How is there not a movie about this guy? I won&#39;t tell the
story here but if you don&#39;t know who he was go read the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Smalls">Wikipedia article</a>.</p>

<p>
Finished off with dinner back at the Glass Onion which was again
superb. If you get down to Charleston, defiantly have a meal or two
there. </p>
<p>
Tomorrow was supposed to be plantation day but there are supposed to
be nonstop thunder storms so it looks like we&#39;ll probably go museum
hopping instead.</p>
