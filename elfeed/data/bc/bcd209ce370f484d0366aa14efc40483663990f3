<p>In this ~30 minute walk, I talk about philosophical themes related to
the hut I built in the mountains of Cyprus.  These are lessons for
life:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Past choices frame future options, meaning that even if we have
perfectly free will, we still operate within confines that cannot be
undone.</li>
  <li>There are moments where we must rise to the occasion, effectively
becoming someone we were not.  Never underestimate someone who has
no other choice but to fight.</li>
  <li>The prevailing conditions make the person.  They compel one into
action.</li>
  <li>Mental fortitude depends on oneâ€™s patience and understanding of the
bigger picture.  It is about how one can preserve their unflinching
commitment to the cause.</li>
  <li>Story about mental fortitude and the ancient Spartans.</li>
  <li>Commentary on the subjectivity of experiences and the illusion of
factual objectivity.</li>
  <li>Why narratives matter to us in our everyday life and why our outlook
is important.</li>
  <li>Faith is inescapable.  We rely on beliefs to cover for the imperfect
information at our disposal as well as our lack of perfect insight.</li>
</ul>
