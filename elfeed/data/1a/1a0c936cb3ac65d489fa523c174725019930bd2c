Hey Crafters!
</p>

 <p>
I have another new teammate on the Crafted Emacs project, Stefan Thesing ( <a href="https://github.com/sthesing">@sthesing</a>) is now a co-maintainer!  I am so excited to be working with him on this project.  There is continuing work on Crafted Emacs, and now with Stefanâ€™s help, even more is being accomplished! We even have a plan for an RC1 release!  See my  <a href="https://write.as/jeffbowman/crafted-emacs-update-for-august-and-another-new-teammate">my blog post</a> to get all the updates for this month!
</p>

 <p>
Happy Crafting!
