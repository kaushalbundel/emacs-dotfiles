<p>What follows is an excerpt from a private exchange. I am sharing it
with the permission of my correspondent, without disclosing their

<blockquote>
  <p>I’ve been enjoying your philosophy videos. I’d love to hear your thoughts
about pursuing knowledge, how to deal with our own ignorance and the
ignorance of others, and pedantry.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sure, I am happy to help however I can. In short:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The pursuit of knowledge is fine, provided you do not feel inhibited
by the absence of knowledge. A common example of self-induced
powerlessness is the scientist who voices no opinion on what is
happening around them on the premise that “I am not an expert”, then
suffers from political decisions with a direct effect on their
science. Who are the experts in politics? Why must we think in terms
of all or nothing and choose nothing?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No matter how knowledgeable you are, you will never have perfect
insight. Forget about theoretical issues and think about everyday
stuff, such as finding a pet dog: you cannot learn everything about
the specific animal before living with it. All you can do in the
beginning is start with the fairly limited knowledge you have, trust
that it will work, and learn as you go. Our choices in life come
with a degree of uncertainty and so we must accept the fact that we
are always partially relying on our beliefs/faith to fill in the
blanks.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As for pedantry, you will feel free once you learn to ignore it and
not do it to others. The expression “sod off” is an excellent way to
deal with pedants.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>As someone who loves computers and computing since an early age, I’ve found
it increasingly difficult to dig through the noise of a field that differs
from others, in the sense that it abnormally welcomes people who are not
necessarily with their souls invested in it. I do not think that this is
inherently a bad thing — different people have different goals in life —
although I can’t help but to notice it’s consequences for people like me.</p>

  <p>I’m a young computer engineering student, so I don’t really know if that
was always the case, but being someone like me — someone that would be in
this field even if it didn’t paid well — in this day and age is somewhat
discouraging.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I imagine there are lots of fields where people work in them without
being enthusiastic about them. It has to do with the fact that “it’s
just a job”. There are practical reasons to pick a profession. Though
yes, when not many people care, the working environment can be
uninspiring.</p>

<p>The point though is that you do not control the prevailing conditions.
You can try to change them, perhaps together with others, though the
odds are against you. If you are disappointed by how things stand, you
must either learn to tolerate this state of affairs or find something
else that does not drain you of your vitality. This goes back to the
point of lacking perfect knowledge: when you <em>feel</em> really bad about
something, consider trusting your body and don’t wait too long for
some irrefutable personalised truth to be revealed to you, since in
practice you do not have the luxury to wait.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Real life is lonely. Social media seems devoid of value, content online was
reduced to “X vs Y”, “which [X tool] is better?”, “never do that!” and that
kind of stuff. Most discussions online provide little to no value because
of the urge to prove a point, gain influence, and preserve the ego. Truth
was left as last priority, claiming without truly knowing became the norm.
For most people, if it works, if it lands you a job, there’s no need to
know deeper.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are right. Though this is not an Internet-only phenomenon. If you
ever go to a village café, you will find non-techie people who (i) are
too opinionated about topics they know nothing about, while (ii)
constantly switch topics as soon as you try to go a bit deeper. I
guess people prefer to take it easy when they can.</p>

<p>Same idea for the “claiming without knowing” part. Socrates was
pointing this out in ancient Athens, for example (relevant comment of
mine, though it assumes some familiarity with the topic:
<a href="https://protesilaos.com/commentary/2023-07-25-comments-socrates-apology/">https://protesilaos.com/commentary/2023-07-25-comments-socrates-apology/</a>).</p>

<p>I am pointing these out to suggest that we better not have too high
expectations about what people should be doing. If we are disappointed
and/or frustrated about such a common issue, we will keep
encountering it again and again without the power to stop it. The
solution is, again, to tolerate what we perceive as imperfection and
work with what we have.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’ve found me struggling to accept myself.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Many of my comments are on the theme of acceptance. It is about
recognising how things stand, not how we would like them to be. Such
recognition extends to our self, where we acknowledge what we can and
cannot affect. Without acceptance, we suffer because there is a
misalignment between our idealised view of the world and its
actuality. Put simply, we are on the right path when we accept that we
are all human and that what we imagine is true for angels is only true
for them, not us.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Often my preferences lead me to places that are rather unusual, tools that
are not the most popular, like emacs. Suddenly, I find myself in the edge
of communities that are small, but full of the most brilliant people, in
that moment I know deep in my guts that my choices will lead me to
fulfilment, but I struggle to jump in. “Is that it? Isn’t it weird that
most people are wrong and I’m right?” I think often.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you think about it, it is likely that most people are wrong about
most things. Suppose you survey a 100 random folks on an engineering
issue you are an expert in: their average opinion does not really
matter to you because you still know better.</p>

<p>Finding niche communities and, generally, not going with the majority
is not a problem per se. The tricky part is to make those choices
while remaining open-minded. For example, you choose Emacs because you
like it right now, but still do not want to be fanatical about it: if,
say, a NeoVim user shows you a workflow that is better than the Emacs
equivalent, you acknowledge as much. Otherwise, all is good.</p>

<p>The pitfall with niche topics is that you may become one-dimensional
if you are too invested in them. Try to learn more about general
issues in the world around you. They will help you keep things in
perspective and thus remain open-minded. It also is good to have
varied interests as you can connect better with people while also have
more diverse stimuli for your intuition.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I feel overwhelmed by the sheer scale computing has become. The
psychological effect of the mass opinion diverging from yours is not
negligible, and not everyone has the nature to fight that. I guess I care
too much about what other people think.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Caring can be a good thing because it shows you are sensitive to what
is happening around you. The key, however, is to care with moderation,
i.e. to recognise the “too much” and know it is harmful. This is easy
to say, but hard to do. Be mindful of it though and try to practice
where possible.</p>
