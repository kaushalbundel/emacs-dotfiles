In one study, defaulting new workers into a retirement plan increased the number of employees contributing to their retirement plans from approximately <a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w12009.pdf">60% to well over 95%</a>.

You tell the payroll provider where to send you money. What bank account do you want your $$ to be deposited into?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In a behavioral science world, what should happen?&nbsp;The ideal flow is to save when you get paid. Most of the money would go to your checking account, but some (2%, 3%, 5%?) would be directed into your savings account. This would happen automatically every month. Boom&#8212;America has savings.&nbsp;</p><p>Sadly, this does not exist.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Gusto, Rippling, and Intuit don&#8217;t make it easy to&nbsp;&#8216;save when you get paid&#8217; during sign-up for direct deposit. In fact, all three payroll providers make it difficult, if not impossible, to add a second bank account within the direct deposit enrollment. None recommend adding your savings account, much less making it the default.&nbsp;</p><p>The good news: there are new kids on the block. <a href="https://www.pinwheelapi.com/products/deposit-switch">Pinwheel</a> and Stripe, for instance, offer services that make it easier for consumers to do deposit switching. This means I can switch my direct deposit to go into a new bank account!
