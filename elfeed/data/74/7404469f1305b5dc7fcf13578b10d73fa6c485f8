<p>In this video I show a bit of the work I am doing to prevent rainwater
from eroding the side of a road. This is outside my land, but I still
have responsibility to keep everything in order. While working, I also
talk about some of the tangible benefits of manual labour with regard
to peace of mind and character building.</p>
