<p><strong>TLDR: WATCH THE VIDEO (click above)</strong></p><p>Clarifying point: this teardown is about a <a href="https://copilot.money/">fintech app</a> that helps you <strong>manage your money</strong>, not Sam Altman&#8217;s new company&#8217;s product Copilot. :)&nbsp;</p><p>If you&#8217;re having conversion/onboarding problems, you should talk to fintech people. If anyone should know how to do onboarding, it&#8217;s them. They have to get their users to <strong>do hard things</strong>&#8212;for instance, sync their bank account, set up a password and PIN, and verify via email. OMG that is hard! But we can do hard things, right? Right?&nbsp;&#129320;</p><p>Copilot&#8217;s onboarding flow has some clever hacks hidden in it. For starters, I love how they frame notification opt-ins. But they also missed some opportunities to <strong>make hard things more fun</strong> (spoiler: I end up saying &#8220;make it like &#8216;hot or not&#8217;&#8221; 5+ times in this teardown).&nbsp;&#129763;</p><p>TL;DR: consumer fintech products are either dead or have yet to come alive. What do I mean? With the death of Mint, there could be a new opening for an app to help consumers manage their money. Think about it: we all spend more than we want and save less than we want. We all want to have more money.&nbsp; This should be a <strong>massive market</strong>.&nbsp;&#128200;</p><p>But to date, fintech products haven&#8217;t <strong>made it easy enough</strong>. People don&#8217;t sync all their accounts. They don't recategorize their money and budget every week. They don&#8217;t trust the pie charts.&nbsp;&#128530;</p><p>So if you want to nail your fintech product, you can&#8217;t follow the same old recipe (Copilot, this means you). My hope? That AI will breathe new life into the financial management conundrum&#8212;and make <strong>doing hard things</strong> fundamentally easier. &#129302;</p><p>Watch this teardown if you&#8217;re <strong>working on onboarding</strong> or are <strong>in consumer fintech</strong>.</p><p><strong>Things I rant on</strong>:<br>&#128181; Transaction categorization<br>&#128181;  Empty states<br>&#128181;  Budgeting<br>&#128181;  Notification opt-ins</p><p>&#8230;and more.&nbsp;&#128161;</p><p>See you next time. &#128075;</p><div class="native-video-embed" data-component-name="VideoPlaceholder" data-attrs="{&quot;mediaUploadId&quot;:&quot;cfc81f31-2a83-4ae1-a8a1-73cfdb322cad&quot;,&quot;duration&quot;:null}"></div><p><em><strong>Have a friend who would enjoy these teardowns?
