Haven&#39;t written up the last few days but I thought <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/15">today&#39;s</a> Advent of
Code problem was worth a few words. I might still go back and write up
a few other ones, and who knows if I&#39;ll finish any more problems - Is
stopped around here last year. We&#39;ll see.</p>
<p>
I liked today&#39;s challenge because it was a nice introduction to hash
tables. Specifically, to solve the problem, you implement a simple
open hash table. In some cases, you could use your languages built in
hash table but then you&#39;d have to already know something about it.</p>
<p>
Part 1 had you do some parsing and calculating a hash function.</p>
<p>
Part 2 required building a table of 256 items where each item held an
unknown list of data items. Based on your input data, you had to
either add a new item, delete an ite, or update the value of an item
already in the table.</p>
<p>
Basically a hash table. Even though the question doesn&#39;t explicitly
say &#34;hash table&#34; it does define <strong>HASH</strong> function* and calls the process
you are going to perform the &#34;Holiday ASCII String Helper Manual
Arrangement Procedure, or <strong>HASHMAP</strong> for short.&#34;</p>
<p>
Why do I like this problem. First off, it&#39;s a nice and different way
to introduce hash tables in a data structure classes but more
importantly I think this type of approach can be used as a unit in a
boot camp type class.</p>
<p>
I can&#39;t tell you how many boot camp developed programmers and PD
trained teachers use built in hash tables with no understanding of
their limitations or in some cases real power. They use them because
they were taught them and they&#39;re &#34;easy.&#34; Dictionaries in Python or
Javascript become the universal hammer.</p>
<p>
An approach like this can be built by a relative beginner in Python,
Javascript or similar using the basic constructs, including built in
dictionaries but then can give a platform to explore has tables more
deeply. It can also be a platform to discuss variant data structures -
a hash table, but you can&#39;t just use the built in Python dictionary.</p>
<p>
So, I&#39;d recommend checking this one out.</p>

The problem, once again can be found <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/15">here</a> and my solution (in
Clojure), <a href="https://gitlab.com/zamansky/advent2023/-/blob/main/src/day15.clj?ref_type=heads">here</a>.</p>
