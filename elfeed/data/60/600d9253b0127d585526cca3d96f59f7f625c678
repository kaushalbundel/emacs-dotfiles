<p>
We started walking from our hotel to the <a href="https://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/en">Van Gogh</a> museum. On the way
we passed the <a href="https://cowmuseum.amsterdam/">Cow Parade</a> store. This was pretty cool since we remember
the Cow Parade from back when it was in New York decades ago. Big
fiberglass painted cows at random spots in the city.</p>

<p>
The Van Gogh museum was pretty amazing (and also had wood
floors). While most of his best known works might be in other museums
around the world there were plenty of great ones to view and admire.</p>

<p>
There were also plenty of work from his contemporaries</p>

<p>
It was particularly interesting to see things like a gallery of his
influences or walls with his works surrounded by similar works by his
contemporaries.</p>
<p>
Like the Rijksmuseum this is a must see. We did hear a couple comment
though while standing online that it always sells out so maybe book
tickets in advance.</p>
<p>
From there we wanted to see the Ann Frank house</p>

<p>
With so much else to do we decided not to book the tour in advance and
that we&#39;d just walk by. We already knew the story so thought we&#39;d
rather spend the time in the WWII Resistance museum and the Jewish
Museum to learn about things we were less familiar with but would walk
by the house to see it and the neighborhood.</p>
<p>
On the way we needed sustenance so we sought out a highly recommended
cookie shop but were thwarted by a <strong>huge</strong> line.</p>

<p>
It looked like it would be well over a 45 minute wait. Sorry, we don&#39;t
do that anymore. We found something else, walked by the Ann Frank
house, did some more wandering, had a great light lunch then took a
break back at our hotel.</p>
<p>
Then the Jewish Museum. It had two parts with two additional ones
opening in March - the museum, on the site of former Ashkenazi
synagogues, the Portuguese Synagogue across the street and the two to
come pieces, the <a href="https://jck.nl/en/location/hollandsche-schouwburg">Hollandsche Schouwburg</a> and the <a href="https://jck.nl/en/location/national-holocaust-museum">National Holocoust
Museum</a>. The next post will cover the Portuguese Synagogue but to be
honest, the museum didn&#39;t thrill either of us. The general Judaism
section was fine but not inspirational and the organization had you
jumping from station to station in what appeared to be random
order. They had some interesting artifacts and we learned a bit but it
wasn&#39;t super engaging to us. The Holocaust section also was pretty
subdued. To be honest, the WWII Resistance museum painted a better
picture of the Holocaust as did the Brussels museum. I&#39;d also rank the
NY and DC ones better. As to the straight Jewish part we also liked the
Brussels museum more and I&#39;ll put in a plug here for the
<a href="https://theweitzman.org/">Weitzman Museum</a> in Philly.</p>
<p>
In all fairness though this isn&#39;t counting the Portuguese Synagogue
which was included in admission but we couldn&#39;t go to yet since it was
closed for Simchat Torah and who knows what the forthcoming two sites
will add to the overall experience</p>
<p>
Staying on our cultural theme, we&#39;ve been noticing many bagel shops in
Amsterdam so we thought we&#39;d try one.</p>

<p>
We ended up taking out form <a href="https://soupenzo.nl/">Soup En Zo</a>, a really good soup place
and pairing the soups with Bagels from Tony&#39;s NY Bagels across the
street. The soups were great and the bagels were surprisingly
good. Not too large, good chew - better than some lesser NY ones.</p>
<p>
That was it for day 3. Day 4 started with the Amsterdam
<a href="https://www.hetscheepvaartmuseum.com/">Maritime Museum</a>. Really interesting. Some good history of the region
as well as boat and boat history. I really liked the modalities
used. Many galleries combined wonderful art - paintings in particular
to tell the story of Amsterdam</p>

<p>
They also had a replica of an old 18th century trade ship that you
could explore.</p>
<img src="https://cestlaz.github.io/img/amsterdam/smallroom.jpg" alt="/img/amsterdam/smallroom.jpg" title="/img/amsterdam/smallroom.jpg" width="250px"/>
<p>
Pretty cramped particularly when you consider that statistically
people form the Netherlands are the tallest in the world.</p>
<p>
They also had old maps:</p>

<img src="https://cestlaz.github.io/img/amsterdam/maps.jpg" alt="/img/amsterdam/maps.jpg" title="/img/amsterdam/maps.jpg" width="250px"/>
<p>
Ship models:</p>

<p>
and much more.</p>
<p>
For lunch we then walked out to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java-eiland">Java Eiland</a> where we passed the Meta
offices but Batya didn&#39;t go in.</p>
<img src="https://cestlaz.github.io/img/amsterdam/meta.jpg" alt="/img/amsterdam/meta.jpg" title="/img/amsterdam/meta.jpg" width="250px"/>
<p>
And then back near the Hotel to finally visit the Portuguese Synagogue.</p>

<p>
Wow. While we were disappointed in the Jewish Museum, this part, which
was right across the street made it super worth it. You basically
walked around the outer perimeter of the site going in and out of
buildings where various religious functions occurred and got to hear
about the function and specific history from past congregations. We
also went in to explore the sanctuary. Again, wow. Big, beautiful,
candle lit (that is, no electricity) and in fact is still functioning.</p>
<p>
As much as the previous days museum visit was meh, this pushed the
overall experience over the top.</p>
<p>
That&#39;s it for today except for a new place for dinner which we&#39;ll head
out for soon. Tomorrow, the plan is to go to the Hague for the Escher
Museum and then Wednesday, back to NYC.</p>
