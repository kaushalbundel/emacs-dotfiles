<p>In this video I show how I venture through the nearby creek. I had to
get to the spot where I have installed a pipe that brings water to my
hut. I need the water to produce concrete with which I will seal off
parts of the hutâ€™s walls that still leak water. This is a big project
and I keep going. In the video, I also share some thoughts on dealing
with hardship.</p>
