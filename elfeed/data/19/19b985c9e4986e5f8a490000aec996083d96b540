<p>Last night, as I was walking out of the cinema where I had just watched <em>Food
for Profit</em>,<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="https://manueluberti.eu/feed.xml#fn:1">1</a></sup> I could not help but think about the people around me. It is
pretty easy to say that maybe I am not the kind of person Innocenzi’s and
D’Ambrosi’s documentary aims at. Why would I need an investigation such as this
to move me towards ethical choices that by now I have already been following for
over ten years? And yet, beside supporting this much too necessary endeavor, I
was curious to sit in a room with other people and sense the impact its images
would have on eyes possibly not accustomed to the reality of intensive farming.</p>
<p>Let me start by simply saying that if one cares in any way about the world we
live in, then they should not ignore this work. Furthermore, at the moment in
Italy it is nearly impossible not to find a screening. Its authors have been
literally reaching every corner of this country to make sure everyone has a
chance to see the results of their five-year long effort. Considering that this
is an independent film which relies on word of mouth, because big producers and
giant distributors have no interest in alienating the meat industry,
Innoncenzi’s and D’Ambrosi’s willingness to share what they believe in is
absolutely remarkable.</p>
<p>However, I had my misconceptions about the film. Somehow I was expecting it to
be solely criticism about European agricultural politics, as if the whole point
of the documentary was to expose politicians not behaving as one would suppose,
which would have been barely a surprise nowadays. This is only a part of what
Innoncenzi and D’Ambrosi do, though. They cannot and do not want to hide the
inevitable consequences of what some inept members of the European Parliament
agree upon. Animal suffering, diseases, environmental disasters, exploitation of
workers: it is all here in its vivid, horrific evidence.</p>
<p>After what I learnt from <em>Earthlings</em><sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="https://manueluberti.eu/feed.xml#fn:2">2</a></sup> and <em>Dominion</em><sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="https://manueluberti.eu/feed.xml#fn:3">3</a></sup> I should be used to
mindless violence, but the shock always manages to unsettle me, just as it
always takes me a moment to recover from the fact that we seem incapable of
treating animals and other people with the same principles of humanity we
believe to have perfected over the course of history. <em>Food for Profit</em> acts as
a powerful reminder of how we constantly and comfortably forget those principles
in order to enjoy privileges that we choose not to question. As Innocenzi said
to us at the end of the screening, we usually expect documentaries such as this
from the US. It is about time Europe comes to terms with the same atrocities
that we like to think are far way from us.</p>
<p>This is what one should really focus on as they watch the film. I can hardly
trust critics who pick at Innoncenzi for posing herself in a sort of egocentric,
Michael Moore-like kind of way.<sup id="fnref:4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="https://manueluberti.eu/feed.xml#fn:4">4</a></sup> On the contrary, I believe that she needs to
put herself right within these images and back them as strongly as she can. She
has every right to use her public persona to engage with viewers, because I do
not see this work as art for art’s sake, nor I see any point in approaching it
with the dissecting eye of a film critic. There is simply too much at stake in
this documentary to look at it with questionable, rational detachment or
reductionist arguments.</p>
<p>And this is why last night I found people’s reactions more honest and important
than any critique. We were all shaken by the cruelty and the indifference we had
witnessed, but I was genuinely surprised by the sincere concern many showed at
the end. Innocenzi kindly replied to all the questions, most of which dealt with
what can we do now, what is actually feasible and what, if any, are the hopes
for a better world. If one, like me, finds it really difficult to believe that
the planet and whoever lives on it can put up with human actions any longer,
people’s response to <em>Food for Profit</em> will be enough to placate the heart for a
while.</p>

<p>See Matteo Marelli’s “review” on <em>FilmTv</em>. The cheap scepticism used to
dismiss the actual point of <em>Food for Profit</em> tells me more about Marelli
than the film itself. <a class="footnote-backref" href="https://manueluberti.eu/feed.xml#fnref:4">↩︎</a></p>
