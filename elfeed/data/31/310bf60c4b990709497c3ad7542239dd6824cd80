<p>In this video I show how to make a contribution to emacs.git (core GNU
Emacs project).  There are multiple steps involved and you want to do
things the right way.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 2023-08-04 11:27 +0300:</strong> In the video I did not mention the
commands <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vc-prepare-patch</code> (Emacs 29+) and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">submit-emacs-patch</code>
(Emacs 28+).  They are designed to streamline the process of preparing
and submitting patches.  If you are on Emacs 29 or higher, just call
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vc-prepare-patch</code> and it will handle the rest.  I also did not
mention the excellent <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">magit</code> package, as that would have made the
video much longer (I use both VC and Magit, depending on what I am
doing, with the latter being more featureful).  Magit can format
patches and can also insert the “change log” skeleton needed for
commits to the emacs.git repository.</p>
