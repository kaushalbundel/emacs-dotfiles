<p><strong>TLDR: WATCH THE VIDEO (click above)</strong></p><p>You and your team just built an AI feature. You&#8217;ve spent time and money on it and now you want people to use it! Makes sense. How should you introduce it?&nbsp;</p><p>Luckily, Canva has shown us what NOT to do&#8212;and also what TO do.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What not to do</strong>: Go heavy on opt-in. Every click= drop-off. And for Canva, it took me 3 clicks. 3!!! These aren't just physical clicks; they&#8217;re <strong>psychological speed bumps</strong> that can stop even the most eager users in their tracks.</p><p><strong>What to do: </strong>While you&#8217;re designing in the app, they give you small ways to optimize using their automated features.
