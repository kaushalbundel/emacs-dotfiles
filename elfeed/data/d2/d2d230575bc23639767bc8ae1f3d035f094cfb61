If you hate self-promotion and putting yourself out there, I think it can really help. (See the P.S. at the end of this letter.)  </p><p>Here are 10 things I wanted to share this week:</p><ol><li><p>From the desert to the ocean: Meg and I started our leap day with a sunrise in <a href="https://www.nps.gov/jotr/index.htm">Joshua Tree National Park</a> and finished it with a sunset view on <a href="http://malibupier.com">Malibu Pier</a>. In between, we hiked <a href="https://www.nps.gov/places/hidden-valley-trailhead.htm">Hidden Valley</a>, took in the panorama at <a href="https://www.nps.gov/jotr/planyourvisit/keysview.htm">Keys View</a>, and strolled the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/jotr/learn/nature/cholla-cactus-garden.htm">Cholla Cactus Garden</a>. We drank a shake at <a href="https://shieldsdategarden.com">Shields Date Garden</a> and had a heavenly pastrami reuben at <a href="https://shermansdeli.com">Sherman&#8217;s Deli</a> in Palm Springs. We put an end to 3 hours of LA traffic with a beautiful drive down <a href="https://www.socalregion.com/highways/scenic_drives/malibu-canyon-road/">Malibu Canyon Road</a>. Exhausting, but exhilarating. <br><br></p></li><li><p>Desert reading: I spent a full post-gig afternoon poolside at the <a href="https://acehotel.com/palm-springs/">Ace Hotel</a>, reading <em><a href="https://geni.us/0vBpxfT">Desert Oracle</a></em>, a handsome paperback collection of <a href="https://www.desertoracle.com">the Joshua Tree-based zine</a>. I found Edward Abbey&#8217;s <em><a href="https://geni.us/7G8p">Desert Solitaire</a></em> a little misanthropic at first, but after driving I-10 for a bit I was in the right mood. (I picked up Sheila Heti&#8217;s <em><a href="https://geni.us/2Z4dw">Alphabetical Diaries</a> </em>at the wonderful <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mvbabookstore/">Malibu Village Books</a>, which has one of the best selections I&#8217;ve ever browsed in a shop that size.)      <br><br></p></li><li><p>Desert power: As part of our whirlwind vacation recovery plan, we I saw <em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15239678/">Dune: Part Two</a></em> at the <a href="https://drafthouse.com/">Alamo Drafthouse</a>. It ruled. (I read <a href="https://geni.us/KvqxgJg">the book</a> last August when Texas felt like Arrakis.) One little detail I noticed: <a href="https://twitter.com/austinkleon/status/1765184710660030475">composer Hans Zimmer obviously loves Ennio Morricone</a>. <br><br></p></li><li><p>Desert listening: I&#8217;m enjoying <a href="https://soundcloud.com/atlasminor/chaos-is-your-new-lady">this spooky reverb-drenched mix</a> and <a href="https://submittedforyourperusal.com/2024/03/04/burgrs-tanzerouft/">this Dune-meets-Kraftwerk concept album</a>. <br><br></p></li><li><p>Back home in Austin, Texas, the trees and the bluebonnets are blooming and everybody&#8217;s gearing up for the invasion of <a href="https://www.sxsw.com">SXSW</a>. I&#8217;m not doing anything official this year, but I plan to occasionally bike around and soak up the madness. People often ask me for recommendations when they come here. If you&#8217;re downtown, I will say: use <a href="https://www.austintexas.gov/department/ann-and-roy-butler-hike-and-bike-trail-and-boardwalk-lady-bird-lake">the hike and bike trail</a> as much as possible, get tacos at <a href="https://veracruzallnatural.com">Veracruz</a>, and venture at least as far as <a href="https://terryblacksbbq.com/austin/">Terry Black&#8217;s</a> for BBQ.  <br><br></p></li><li><p>Walk the hike and bike a mile west from the convention center and you&#8217;ll arrive at our civic cathedral, <a href="https://library.austintexas.gov/central-library">The Austin Public Library</a>. Take in the view on the roof and check out the <a href="https://library.austintexas.gov/apl-shop">Recycled Reads</a> gift shop downstairs for souvenirs. If you&#8217;re tired, you can get queso and chips at <a href="https://torchystacos.com">Torchy&#8217;s</a>, a smoothie at the <a href="https://www.juiceland.com">JuiceLand</a>, or a picnic at the Trader Joe&#8217;s nearby. If you have a bit more energy, you can either walk south on the <a href="https://guidetoaustinarchitecture.com/places/james-d-pfluger-pedestrian-bridge/">pedestrian bridge</a> across the river and hit Terry Black&#8217;s BBQ, or you can head north on what I call the <a href="https://austinkleon.com/2018/05/12/shoal-creek-book-walk/">Shoal Creek Book Walk</a> and get to the corner of 6th and Lamar, where you can shop at the flagship Whole Foods, buy my books signed at <a href="https://www.bookpeople.com/signed-books-austin-kleon">Bookpeople</a>, and possibly catch a free day show at <a href="https://waterloorecords.com">Waterloo Records</a>. <br><br></p></li><li><p>Another nice walk from the convention center is north along the <a href="https://naturerocksaustin.org/greenspace/waller-creek-greenbelt">Waller Creek Greenbelt</a> and up to the brand-new <a href="https://waterloogreenway.org">Waterloo Greenway</a>. Go a bit further north and you can hit <a href="http://www.scholzgarten.com">Scholz Garden</a>, where our best radio station, <a href="https://kutx.org">KUTX 98.9</a>, is throwing a series of <a href="https://kutx.org/kutx-presents/live-at-scholz-garten-2024/">morning shows open to the public</a>. A few blocks north of that and you can take in the <a href="https://blantonmuseum.org">Blanton Museum</a>&#8217;s wonderful show of <a href="https://blantonmuseum.org/exhibition/anni-albers/">Anni Albers&#8217; thread and paper work</a>. A few blocks west is <a href="https://www.hrc.utexas.edu">The Harry Ransom Center</a>, the gem of The University of Texas. If you aren&#8217;t dead of heatstroke by then, you can walk back downtown through the Texas Capitol grounds (take a selfie with <a href="https://austinkleon.com/2019/10/28/the-ten-commandments/">The Ten Commandments!</a>) and down Congress Avenue. <br><br></p></li><li><p>Radio: We have <em>great</em> stations here. In addition to <a href="https://kutx.org">KUTX 98.9 FM</a>, there&#8217;s classical <a href="https://www.kmfa.org">KMFA 89.5 FM</a> and our community <a href="https://koop.org">KOOP 91.7 FM</a>. I&#8217;d add those as favorites to the <a href="http://radio.garden/visit/austin-tx">Radio Garden</a> app before I came down. (You can stream all those stations online, of course. Just this week I discovered <a href="https://koop.org/program/the-joystick-jukebox/">The Joystick Jukebox</a>: a one-hour show of video game music I&#8217;ve started listening to with my kids.)<br><br></p></li><li><p>Film: I saw <a href="https://www.austinfilm.org/screening/an-evening-with-don-hertzfeldt/">Don Hertzfeld&#8217;s new short film</a> last night with Mike Judge in attendance, and I&#8217;m looking forward to Richard Linklater&#8217;s episode of <em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt30320959/">God Save Texas</a></em>. There are a lot of movies I wouldn&#8217;t mind seeing at SXSW, but two in particular caught my eye: <em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt30835342/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1">Faders Up: The John Aielli Experience</a> </em>and the new flick by the Ross Brothers, <em><a href="https://schedule.sxsw.com/2024/films/2196991?_gl=1*1g4yhaf*_ga*MTQ3MzIyNjQzLjE3MDk4MzE2OTU.*_ga_RLXXHDCCN4*MTcwOTgzMTY5NS4xLjEuMTcwOTgzMTczMi4yMy4wLjA.&amp;_ga=2.223211355.1940336480.1709831696-147322643.1709831695">Gasoline Rainbow</a></em>. (It was <em>fifteen</em> years ago at SXSW 2009 that I drew their breakout documentary, <em><a href="https://austinkleon.com/2009/08/06/45365/">45365</a>. </em>They wound up using the drawing as <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1337139/">the poster</a>, of which the late great Roger Ebert said, &#8220;<a href="https://tumblr.austinkleon.com/post/4912028416">Now this is a great movie poster</a>.&#8221;) <br><br></p></li><li><p>Finally, to make up for our lost Flaco and the owls that have disappeared in my backyard: Athena, the resident great horned owl at <a href="https://www.wildflower.org/visit/athena-the-owl">the Ladybird Johnson Wildflower Center</a> south of town, now has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUT3nZJWn64">her own 24/7 Cornell Nest Cam</a>.
