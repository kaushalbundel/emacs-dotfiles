<p>Hi everyone, I&#8217;ve got some news.</p><p>The short version is that starting mid-July, I will join Baillie Gifford&#8217;s private company team, looking to back the best founders in China and beyond. I will keep writing the bi-weekly free newsletter, but the paid version is going away.</p><p>Going forward, I will still focus my work on the type of business model analysis and sector review we&#8217;ve come to expect from Chinese Characteristics. The key difference will be that there will be no specific predictions about sectors and companies. But overall, same old Chinese Characteristics.</p><p>Premium subscribers, thanks for supporting me. Without your membership, I wouldn&#8217;t have been able to sustain myself in this new land. Thank you, thank you, thank you. The important things we repeat three times. You&#8217;ll be getting a pro-rata refund soon from Chinese Characteristics - let me know via email if that hasn&#8217;t come through.</p><p>The long version is that I knew I was in a local maxima when working in VC in Europe. By leaving, I didn&#8217;t know whether I could ever reach the imagined global maximium, but after so many years of backing founders, I wanted to wholeheartedly back myself. I knew that a version of that future would be in China, though I didn&#8217;t know what it would be. As Covid-induced isolation reminded me how little time we really have, I decided to meet that future. Immigrants know in their bones that the cost of your new life is your old one.</p><p>So I packed my life into two bags and said goodbye to all that.</p><p>Once in China, I<a href="https://lillianli.substack.com/p/chinese-characteristics-one-year?s=w"> wrote to sense make</a>. With your support, astonishing luck and some grind, I made it work and started living the life of a &#8216;creator&#8217;. The creator life was often great - I had complete ownership of my work. I explored what I wanted when I wanted. I wrote on trains, in cafes but mostly from my attic in Shanghai. I leaned on my lifelong skill of information arbitrage and forged connections with anyone who&#8217;d talk to me in the tech sector. I made some fantastic friends and honed my thinking through writing. I posted absurd tweets and built a Twitter following. I made something that people wanted.</p><p>The creator life was also often terrible. It&#8217;s the life of a founder without the ability to leverage teams. Like<a href="https://www.notboring.co/p/a-not-boring-adventure-one-year-in"> </a>other Substack writers have opined, writing and researching are not things you can delegate well to others. As such, it&#8217;s lonely and nerve-wracking. The strain of the balancing act between writing, admin and keeping the vision added up. When things were going well, I worried that it would stop. When things were going badly, I worried even more. In short, it was one of the most stressful periods of my life thus far.</p><p>In the midst of appreciating that anxiety is the dizziness of freedom, I realised I missed investing. I missed the dialogues with passionate founding teams. I missed the ability to back different versions of the future wholeheartedly (which is what I think happens in investing at its finest). I even missed calculating the customer cohorts&#8217; revenue retention levels. At the last point, I realised it must be love and that I should get back into investing.</p><p>Here again, I was incredibly lucky. I initially toyed with the idea of a LL fund, and with the bundles of Chinese regulations, that seemed like an arduous task. As I dithered away at planning a long-term focused, curious and insightful fund that invested in both the public and private market. One came knocking &#8212; synchronicity in action.</p><p>There is much to like about working for oneself in a fund capacity - just like being a creator. But there is much to be said about joining a stellar platform and working to make it even better. I always thought the most sustainable investors are infinite game team players rather than singular superstars. I am very excited to join a team where our visions and values are so matched.</p><p>While this is a new chapter, there&#8217;s still continuation. I&#8217;ll still be writing Chinese Characteristics, and if anything, I think it&#8217;ll be a richer publication due to my having more skin in the game. For clarity, the newsletter will not:</p><ul><li><p>Represent the views of Baillie Gifford in any official capacity - the views will be all mine, and not represent that of my future employer</p></li><li><p>Share any confidential information - If I do share any info, that will be followed by publicly available links</p></li><li><p>Make any predictions on specific companies or industries - compliance laws, you know the drill</p></li></ul><p>The editions will still come out on a bi-weekly schedule. But before then, I will take a sabbatical for two months, during which I would like to not worry about writing for the first time in nearly two years.</p><p>Lastly, thank you all again for reading so far. I feel like we&#8217;ve just started to explore what Chinese tech has to offer the world. Do continue to stick around.</p><p>See you all in September!</p><p>(Or even sooner if you happen to work for Baillie Gifford. I&#8217;ll be dropping by the headquarters soon, so do say hi!)</p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://lillianli.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Chinese Characteristics is a reader-supported publication.
