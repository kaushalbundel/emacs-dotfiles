<p>In this one-hour video I do a first person tour of my mountains, while
talking about philosophical themes. I climb the mountain, showing you
its beautiful slopes and biodiversity.</p>

<p>As I walk, I talk about philosophical themes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Accept how things stand and appreciate what you have.</li>
  <li>Holidays are an opportunity to recognise what is available to us.</li>
  <li>What rituals can teach us, provided we do them in earnest.</li>
  <li>About putting both the mind and body to work.</li>
  <li>How we are not just spiritual or rational agents.</li>
  <li>The beauty of the world and how the natural surrounding provide an
outlet for all facets of our being.</li>
</ul>
