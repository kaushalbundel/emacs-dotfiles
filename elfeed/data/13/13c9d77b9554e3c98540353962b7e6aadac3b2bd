<p><em>This essay is part of the <a href="https://studio.ribbonfarm.com/p/mediocre-computing">Mediocre Computing</a> series.</em></p><p>Last week&#8217;s newsletter (<a href="https://studio.ribbonfarm.com/p/massed-muddler-intelligence">Massed Muddler Intelligence</a>) was hard to write and delayed because for a change I was trying to think like an engineer first, and a writer second. Which means sweating first principles over dreaming up banger memes and metaphors. And since I&#8217;m a better writer than engineer, it was hard. But gratifyingly, as I&#8217;d hoped, I got a lot of good responses from actual practitioners trying to build with AI technology. I think I&#8217;m going to continue with this bias for a while (though this essay should still mostly be comprehensible to non-technical readers), but might attempt a more general-audience synthesis in a few months. Right now developments are happening too fast to translate to general audience mental models.</p><p>This week&#8217;s two major bits of AI news &#8212; the shock-and-awe launch of Sora, OpenAIs video-generation engine, and the rather sorry launch of Gemini 1.5, Google&#8217;s new 10 million-token context LLM  (look them up before proceeding if you haven&#8217;t caught up) &#8212; constitute a real test of your sense-making of developments. </p><p>Which do you think is the more significant development? Vote even if you have really low confidence in your take and would rather not judge. Let&#8217;s use the convenient poll tool Substack just introduced. Vote before you read on.</p><div class="poll-embed" data-attrs="{&quot;id&quot;:147329}" data-component-name="PollToDOM"></div><p>Second question, <em>why </em>do you think what you do?</p><p>Before I share my own answers and analysis, let me offer a provocation that I think sheds light on the correct answer.

Contra Salvatier: Does reality have a surprising <em>lack </em>of detail? A richly textured view of a turbulent ocean by a rocky coastline&#8230;reduced to 280 characters?</p><p>Now consider the Sora vs. Gemini question again in light of the implications of this non-AI video.
