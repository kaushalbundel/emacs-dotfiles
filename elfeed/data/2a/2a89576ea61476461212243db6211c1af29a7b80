<p><strong>TLDR: WATCH THE VIDEO (click above)</strong></p><p>When it comes to UX, the devil is in the details. This is especially true in healthcare, as I was reminded recently when my dad transitioned from Aetna to United Healthcare. So today we&#8217;re putting healthcare UX on the examination table (spoiler: the patient is in critical condition).</p><h2>The Macro Observation: Look Forward, Not Backward</h2><p>It didn&#8217;t start well. UHC&#8217;s <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3068890/">homepage</a> is like a rearview mirror: the focus is on past claims and spending. This is interesting data&#8212;but not necessarily for new users like my dad. Imagine instead a proactive homepage spotlighting actionable items like coverages, nearby providers, or prescription details. This shift from a backward to a <strong>forward-looking approach</strong> could change the game for users&#8212;but the current version is more likely to confuse and repel. Careful, objects in the rearview mirror are closer than they appear.</p><h2>Micro UX Observations</h2><ul><li><p><strong>&#8216;View My Rewards&#8217; dilemma</strong>: This section hits a login wall without initial reward explanations. Why not first tease the benefits? See <a href="https://irrationallabs.com/learn/our-method/">our 3B Framework</a> for behavior change to dive into barriers and benefits tradeoffs.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>Provider search defaults</strong>: The default 20-mile radius for provider searches is overkill. Bringing it down to a more practical 5-mile radius could align better with user behavior. Data from the AI ad targeting platform Dstillery showed that the <a href="https://www.esquire.com/lifestyle/health/news/a54143/missing-gym-workouts/">people who most consistently hit the gym</a> live, on average, 3.7 miles away from it, while occasional gym-goers live 5.1 miles away. Just 1.4 miles can profoundly affect our motivation and habits.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Seamless prescription transitions</strong>: The current lack of continuity in prescription management when switching providers feels&#8230; kinda immoral. His meds that had been set up for home delivery in Aetna are now defaulted to classic pharmacy refills. To re-set up UHC home delivery, I&#8217;d need to really work for it.&nbsp; About 50% of patients<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3068890/"> don&#8217;t take their medications as prescribed</a>. This lapse in adherence leads to increased morbidity, death, and incurs costs of approximately $100 billion per year. Seems like a good time to switch to Amazon Prime refills, huh?</p></li></ul><h2>Big Picture: Health Over Hassle</h2><p>The healthcare sector, including UHC, needs to pivot towards reducing user barriers while highlighting benefits like free video visits or mental health services. Remember, <strong>small changes</strong> in design can lead to <strong>big behavioral shifts</strong>.</p><p>3 Insights from this teardown:</p><p>&#128161;<strong>Proactive</strong> (vs. reactive) UX focused on what users are likely to do next can enhance user engagement and satisfaction</p><p>&#128161;Thoughtful <strong>defaults</strong> can guide users towards beneficial behaviors</p><p>&#128161;Highlighting <strong>visible perks and benefits</strong> upfront can <strong>increase user trust </strong>and adherence (watch my <a href="https://kristenberman.substack.com/p/the-number-one-problem-in-healthcare">LiveHealth teardown</a> to learn more about this)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Wrapping up, as United Healthcare shows, small tweaks in UX can have profound impacts on user behavior. It's not just about flashy features; it's about understanding and designing for the subtleties of how we frequently irrational humans<strong> actually behave</strong>. Especially when it comes to healthcare, these are <strong>real stakes</strong>. Just ask my dad.</p><div class="native-video-embed" data-component-name="VideoPlaceholder" data-attrs="{&quot;mediaUploadId&quot;:&quot;3f513561-6c96-45d1-a52b-05350d48660a&quot;,&quot;duration&quot;:null}"></div><p><em><strong>Have a friend who would enjoy these teardowns?
