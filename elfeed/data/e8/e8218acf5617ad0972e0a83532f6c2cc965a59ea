<p>At the end of this week, I am starting a new chapter of my life: entrepreneurship. This is my last week at <a href="http://crosschx.com">CrossChx</a>, and then I begin splitting my time between contract work and developing some of my own ideas.</p>
<p>I only spent about three quarters of a year at CrossChx, but in that time a lot has happened. I've made some friends who will be with me for a long time. I've written some code that I'm really damn proud of. And I've learned a lot about what I want in life. Right now, what I want in life is the freedom to pursue my dreams, the freedom to make the things that I really care about, the freedom to leave a Nicole-shaped dent on the world.</p>
<p>One of my colleagues requested that I start a blog (I already have one) around my adventures through this new chapter. Other coworkers have asked me to give them tips and updates since they have considered making similar moves. Here it is. I'm going to try to maintain weekly updates (ideally on Fridays) talking about my experiences with both contracting and entrepreneurship / independent development. It isn't really clear what this chapter is going to look like, but it sure will be interesting!</p>
<p>Wish me luck!</p>
