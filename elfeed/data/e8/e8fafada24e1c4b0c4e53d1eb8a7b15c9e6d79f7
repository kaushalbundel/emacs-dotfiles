<p><strong>TLDR: WATCH THE VIDEO (click above)</strong></p><p>Airline loyalty programs are ingrained in how we travel. But it wasn&#8217;t always that way. In fact, in 1980 there were <strong>no loyalty programs</strong> that promised you free flights. And then in 1981, American Airlines launched their program, and 10 days later <strong>United released MileagePlus</strong>.&nbsp;&#129300;</p><p>What happened?</p><p>Most companies don&#8217;t operate in a vacuum. They look at what their competitors are doing and react. This is what United did when American Airlines launched their program&#8212;they reacted.</p><p>It&#8217;s also what people do. We don&#8217;t operate in a vacuum. We look around to others to get cues on <strong>how to behave and what to care about</strong>. &#128064; <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/ideas/robert-frank-on-under-the-influence">Robert Frank calls this &#8216;behavioral contagion&#8217;</a>. If your neighbor gets solar panels on their roof, you&#8217;re <strong>more likely to get them</strong>, too. &#128161;</p><p>And this is the genius of airline programs. They make the <strong>invisible visible</strong>. &#129763; In normal retail loyalty programs, I have no idea what your status is or even if you&#8217;re participating in the program. But with airlines, I know. I know because you get to board in Zone 1 vs. Zone 4. I know because you have access to a fancy lounge. This is a visible display of <strong>what you care about</strong> and <strong>your status</strong>.</p><p>And just like United followed American, I will take the cue and follow you. Airline loyalty programs offer something others don&#8217;t: <strong>public recognition</strong>. &#129299; Whether it&#8217;s boarding earlier or access to exclusive lounges, these visible symbols make others aware of your behavior and more importantly, your status. </p><p>And maybe this is the point: loyalty programs are about <strong>status, not perks</strong>. What people value in them is tangible, visible<strong> </strong>benefits that others can see. Think about how you can tap into that for your product and you&#8217;ll be flying high. &#128105;&#8205;&#9992;&#65039;</p><p><strong>&#128073; 3 things I cover in this teardown:</strong></p><p>&#128748; The psychology behind airlines flaunting visible perks and our innate<strong> need for social recognition<br>&#128748;</strong> Understanding the <strong>emotional weight of unclaimed airline miles</strong> and why they feel different from other rewards<br>&#128748; How airlines craft an illusion of mile ownership before you even claim them, driving deeper<strong> loyalty &amp; engagement</strong></p><p>See you next week &#8212; don&#8217;t forget to claim your miles.<strong> &#128075;</strong></p><div class="native-video-embed" data-component-name="VideoPlaceholder" data-attrs="{&quot;mediaUploadId&quot;:&quot;51307569-f244-495d-8e17-5b94f5400986&quot;,&quot;duration&quot;:null}"></div><p><em><strong>Have a friend who would enjoy these teardowns?
