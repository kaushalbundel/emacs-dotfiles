If you&#8217;re in a creative winter, or just need a little kick in the pants, it might help! </p><p>Here are 10 things I thought were worth sharing this week:</p><ol><li><p>&#8220;Citrus does not come true from seed. If you plant an orange seed, a grapefruit might spring up.&#8221; I&#8217;ve been eating a lot of oranges, so I finally picked up John McPhee&#8217;s <em><a href="https://geni.us/3t4R0HY">Oranges</a></em>, which is just brilliant, and contains more than one <a href="https://austinkleon.substack.com/p/more-ideas-from-the-garden">metaphor for our growing compost heap</a>.<br><br></p></li><li><p>&#8220;Slugs and snails can sleep for hours, days, weeks, and months.&#8221; After reading about <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20231221-the-mystery-of-the-medieval-fighting-snails">the mystery of the medieval fighting snails</a>, I picked up a book about <a href="https://geni.us/d98JiEO">meeting remarkable manuscripts</a> and I read David George Gordon&#8217;s <em><a href="https://www.publishersweekly.com/9781570616112">The Secret World of Slugs and Snails: Life in the Very Slow Lane</a></em>. Fascinating creatures and good inspiration for surviving the rest of winter. (Thanks, <a href="https://buttondown.email/clivethompson/archive/linkfest-17-medieval-fighting-snails-loud/">Clive</a>!)<br><br></p></li><li><p>&#8220;It took so much presence of mind to just not&nbsp;disintegrate into nothingness at the surreality of the experience&#8230;&#8221; Will Oldham spoke to <em><a href="https://lifeoftherecord.com/#/bonnie-prince-billy/">Life of the Record</a></em> about his classic Bonnie &#8220;Prince&#8221; Billy album, <em><a href="https://album.link/i/280377293">I See A Darkness</a></em>. Oldham is so thoughtful and articulate, if you like that conversation, you&#8217;ll enjoy this book of interviews, <em><a href="https://tumblr.austinkleon.com/post/38153880107">Will Oldham on Bonnie &#8220;Prince&#8221; Billy</a>.</em><br><br></p></li><li><p>&#8220;How can we know a dead person? How can we know a living person?&#8221; I&#8217;ve been a fan of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Neely">Brad Neely</a>&#8217;s for years and years &#8212; first for his insanely funny (and NSFW) <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TheRealBradNeely/videos">Creased Comics</a></em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TheRealBradNeely/videos"> videos</a> like &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7y2xPucnAo">JFK</a>&#8221; and &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bar3GOzDNzg">The Professor Brothers</a>&#8221; and then for his brilliant <em>Harry Potter</em> parody, <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wizard_People,_Dear_Reader">Wizard People, Dear Reader</a></em>. It&#8217;s taken him 20 years, but he finally released his first novel, <em><a href="https://geni.us/dKZnmK">You, Me, and Ulysses S. Grant: A Farcical Biography</a></em>. (If you get the audiobook, he reads it in the same voice he narrated <em>Wizard People</em>!)<br><br></p></li><li><p>Stand-up comedy on Netflix: We laughed a lot at Jacqueline Novak&#8217;s <em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt30402897/">Get on Your Knees</a></em>, which is, to quote a profile in <em><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2024/01/22/jacqueline-novak-profile">The New Yorker</a></em>, &#8220;a ninety-minute show about fellatio.&#8221;&nbsp;(Two interesting takeaways from that profile: her decision &#8220;to channel her energies into one exceptional piece of work&#8221; instead of doing a bunch of little things and her resistance to the idea that she found her voice with the show: &#8220;I finally found my confidence, and the way to trick you into liking it.&#8221;) <br><br></p></li><li><p>Eye candy: If you just want to watch something light and chill and beautifully shot, you might try <em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10738536/">Delicious</a></em>, a French period film about a chef that came out a few years ago. Pleasant way to spend a couple hours. (For <a href="https://austinkleon.substack.com/p/pizza-night-movie-logbooks">pizza night</a> with the family, I highly recommend <em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3915174/">Puss in Boots: The Last Wish</a></em>.) <br><br></p></li><li><p>Ear assault: One of my favorite things is to kind of hate a record the first time I hear it, then play it again to see if it&#8217;s as bad as I think it is, and before I know it I&#8217;ve played it three or four times and I can&#8217;t stop listening to it. That happened this week with Geese&#8217;s <em><a href="https://geesebandnyc.bandcamp.com/album/3d-country">3D Country</a></em>.<br><br></p></li><li><p>Ear-soothing ambient: Lou Reed&#8217;s <em><a href="https://loureed.bandcamp.com/album/hudson-river-wind-meditations">Hudson River Wind Meditations</a></em>, which he recorded for his own meditation and Tai Chi. (Speaking of wind meditations: </p><p>Andre 3000 is going <a href="https://pitchfork.com/news/andre-3000-announces-new-blue-sun-live-tour/">out on tour</a> and <a href="https://pitchfork.com/news/outkast-andre-3000-chats-and-performs-on-colbert-watch/">performed on Colbert</a>.)<br><br></p></li><li><p>RIP <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/22/arts/music/mary-weiss-dead.html?unlocked_article_code=1.QU0.rdL3.WLIr1X4YA5Mr&amp;smid=url-share">Mary Weiss</a>, lead singer of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ge8_6rtQvs">The Shangri-Las</a>, who have their own chapter in a book I recently saw on the library&#8217;s &#8220;NEW&#8221; shelf: <em><a href="https://geni.us/cDa4J">But Will You Love Me Tomorrow?: An Oral History of the &#8217;60s Girl Groups</a>.</em><br><br></p></li><li><p>RIP director <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-acclaimed-director-norman-jewison-dead-at-97-explored-social-issues-in/">Norman Jewison</a>, who made one of my all-time favorite movies, the romantic comedy <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MN3sPq9RJKM">Moonstruck</a></em>. Here&#8217;s a remembrance from screenwriter <a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/tributes/he-stood-on-a-firm-piece-of-earth-john-patrick-shanley-on-moonstruck-director-norman-jewison">John Patrick Shanley</a>. If you&#8217;ve never seen <em>Moonstruck</em>, you are in for such a treat. A perfect movie for a cold winter night.</p><p></p></li></ol><p>Thanks for reading.
