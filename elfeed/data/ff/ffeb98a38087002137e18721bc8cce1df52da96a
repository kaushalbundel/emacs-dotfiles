So new plan: here&#8217;s a list of everyone&#8217;s scores, associated with a hash of their email address:</p><div class="file-embed-wrapper" data-component-name="FileToDOM"><div class="file-embed-container-reader"><div class="file-embed-container-top"><image class="file-embed-thumbnail-default" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack.com%2Fimg%2Fattachment_icon.svg"></image><div class="file-embed-details"><div class="file-embed-details-h1">Blind Score Hash</div><div class="file-embed-details-h2">59.5KB &#8729; XLSX file</div></div><a class="file-embed-button wide" href="https://www.astralcodexten.com/api/v1/file/072fbf4b-615e-4dc0-96eb-b4551fdede4d.xlsx"><span class="file-embed-button-text">Download</span></a></div><a class="file-embed-button narrow" href="https://www.astralcodexten.com/api/v1/file/072fbf4b-615e-4dc0-96eb-b4551fdede4d.xlsx"><span class="file-embed-button-text">Download</span></a></div></div><p>Go to <a href="https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/sha256.html">this site</a> and enter the email address you used for the contest. Find the first five characters of the hash on the Excel file, and that&#8217;s you; your score is the next cell over. The highest score was 0.275, the lowest was -2.185, and you can compare to various averages <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F14b48344-51fa-4a5d-bb06-c0f52c5ebd9c_720x468.png">on this graphic</a> from <a href="https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/who-predicted-2023">the post</a>. Eight people had hash collisions and their scores will be ambiguous; if that&#8217;s you, email me if you really want to know. Thanks to Legionnaire for putting this together; I&#8217;ll update you when I know if there are any plans for Full Mode.</p><p><strong>2: </strong>echometer on the subreddit made <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/1bhoozm/i_made_a_mobilefriendly_fast_reader_for_astral/">a mobile-friendly reader for Astral Codex Ten</a> in case you need the page to load a little faster. Again, the last time I told Substack about speed issues, they said they&#8217;ve &#8220;got plans to improve&#8221; it</p><p></p>
