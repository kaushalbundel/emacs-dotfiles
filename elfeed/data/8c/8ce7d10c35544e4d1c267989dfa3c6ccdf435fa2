<p>In this 30-minute video I philosophise about the notion of letting go.
I do it by discussing the ancient myth of Sisyphos.  Themes I cover:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The story of Sisyphos in brief and how it is a metaphor.</li>
  <li>Why I think what happens to Sisyphos is not punishment.  He is doing
it to himself in his ignorance.</li>
  <li>We do not let go of what we treasure the most because we identify
with it.  We consider it an extension of our self.</li>
  <li>The self is not immutable.  It is not constant.  It changes and does
everything around us.</li>
  <li>What comes to our possession or, generally, what we associate or
interact with, does so by coincidence.  We can still not identify
with it.</li>
  <li>We are like travellers who paths converge only to eventually
diverge.</li>
  <li>The concept of non-ownership, which I describe with the Greek word
aktisia (ακτησία).</li>
  <li>How difficult it is to let go as it requires courage and
magnanimity.</li>
  <li>We can start with small and inconsequential things.  This way we can
practice and develop the capacity it takes to let go.</li>
  <li>A story about how Atlas, my dogs, has learnt to let go.  We can do
the same.</li>
</ul>
