<p>I loved math and puzzles for as long as I can remember, but my love affair with cryptography began when a fellow student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign let me borrow his many-times-xerox’d copy of the government-issued technical specification of the Digital Encryption Standard in 1994. (Thank you Dave B., I don’t think I ever returned it!). I was hooked, and even tried to apply to the NSA for an internship, but was promptly rebuffed because I was not (yet) a U.S. citizen. </p><p>Instead, swept up in the first Internet startup wave, I was dreaming up schemes to build a crypto-powered startup. Having moved to Silicon Valley after graduation, I started a company with a guy I met on Stanford campus, Peter Thiel, to do just that — build a company where security was the ultimate source of value creation. The company, which we initially called Confinity (for Confidence and Infinity) was soon renamed PayPal. </p><p>A less public guy, whom I also met at Stanford, is helping award this prize today — Professor Dan Boneh. Dan has been an invaluable helper, sanity-checker, and occasional life- (or at least company-) saver as we designed our security systems at PayPal, and in almost every other project I’ve since gone on to start. (In fact, Dan once helped identify and fix a very ugly software bug in the seed material collector for my random-number generator… instead of going to his own birthday party.)</p><p>Despite never having the patience to complete an advanced degree (which remains my science-minded family’s goal) in cryptography, its applications in the real world remained a critical enabler of much of my success to date.</p><p>So, in October of 2014, I invited a few friends, practitioners and experts in cryptography, to dinner, to discuss the best way to celebrate and promote applied, real-world cryptography and its applications in digital security, as well as aid in broader public awareness of the importance of both. It was that dinner where this prize was born and today,  I am proud to announce the first two recipients of the 1st annual Levchin Prize for Real-World Cryptography. </p><p>Winner 1:<a href="http://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~rogaway/"> Phillip Rogaway</a></p><p>Significance of contribution: Phil is a giant in the area of symmetric encryption. The prize is given for his groundbreaking practice-oriented research, authenticated encryption and his work on format preserving encryption which has had an exceptional impact on real-world cryptography.</p><p>Winner 2:  <a href="https://www.mitls.org/">The miTLS Team</a></p><p>Significance of contribution: miTLS is a verified implementation of the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security"> TLS protocol</a>. In addition to the implementation, the team also uncovered numerous mistakes in the design of TLS and mistakes in many implementations. Their work has influenced the design of many features in the upcoming update to TLS called TLS 1.3.</p><p>I created this prize because I believe technological innovation can improve electronic freedom, privacy, trustworthiness, and safety.  All of us use - and benefit from - applications of cryptography in our daily lives. More than anything, this prize is about drawing attention to the contributions of those in the field and recognizing that cryptography is very special field, in and of itself. <br/></p><p>I hope that this prize encourages younger researchers – especially students – to think about how cryptographic principles can be applied to improve the many flawed systems of today. At a time when governments and corporations are scrambling to stem the rising tide of data breaches, cryptography has never been more important to the security of our economy and our personal privacy. <br/></p><p>P.S.
