<p><strong>TLDR: WATCH THE VIDEO (click above)</strong></p><p>Happy Black Friday! Disclaimer: this is <strong>not a Black Friday sale</strong>. And I&#8217;m not trying to sell you anything&#8212;except maybe behavioral science in the broader sense. &#129297;</p><p>But I <em>was</em> recently shopping for an accent chair on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/marketplace/">Facebook Marketplace</a>, and the experience highlighted the key barriers involved in secondhand shopping:<br><br>1. <strong>Informational</strong>: This chair is nice, but are there others? What do they cost?</p><p>2. <strong>Logistical</strong>: Is this chair worth driving an hour to pick up? Can I get it delivered?</p><p>3. <strong>Mental model</strong>: My understanding of the marketplace is limited. What product categories can I find here? How does it work?</p><h2>The 3B Framework: Black Friday Edition</h2><p>How to fix this? How could an e-commerce platform increase sales without offering <strong>90% off Black Friday Bonanza</strong> <strong>deals</strong>?</p><p>At Irrational Labs, we use the <a href="https://irrationallabs.com/blog/the-3b-framework-the-irrational-labs-approach-to-behavior-change/">3B framework</a>. So in this teardown, I put on my behavioral science hat and ask: how could a savvy PM<strong> </strong>use the 3B&#8217;s (key <strong>b</strong>ehavior, <strong>b</strong>arriers, <strong>b</strong>enefits) to <strong>boost user engagement</strong> and help me get that perfect accent chair? This isn't just about clicks and views; it's about understanding and designing for psychology.</p><p><strong>Topics I touch on</strong>:</p><p>&#129302; Increasing <strong>trust in AI</strong></p><p>&#128722; Balancing<strong> short-term vs. long-term</strong> conversions</p><p>&#129513; Building a <strong>mental model</strong> for your product or service</p><p>Black Friday may be <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/11/22/1212640750/black-friday-2023-shopping-gifts-spending">overhyped</a> but this is one &#8216;sale&#8217; you don&#8217;t want to miss if you want to engage your users more.</p><p>See you next time (by then, hopefully I&#8217;ll have that accent chair). &#128715;&#65039; &#128075;</p><div class="native-video-embed" data-component-name="VideoPlaceholder" data-attrs="{&quot;mediaUploadId&quot;:&quot;3d9225f9-5542-4406-9106-e3c680e78c4e&quot;,&quot;duration&quot;:null}"></div><p><em><strong>Have a friend who would enjoy these teardowns?
