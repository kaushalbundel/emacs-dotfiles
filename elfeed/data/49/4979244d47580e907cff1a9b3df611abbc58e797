Eli Zaretskii writes to tell us that <a href="https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2024-03/msg00611.html">Emacs 29.3 has been released</a>. It’s the first time in a long time—or maybe ever—that I can recall Emacs releasing a security update. It’s an editor, after all, what security issues could it have. The problem is that Emacs is not <i>just</i> an editor: it’s a complete operating environment and some of those files it works on can have active elements.

You can read about the specific issues that the update addresses in the <a href="https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/tree/etc/NEWS?h=emacs-29">NEWS</a> file but they’re just what you’d think they would be. The fixes mainly tighten down on existing safeguards that prevent Emacs from executing possibly malicious Elisp.

As I always say, thanks to Eli and the other developers for their work on this release. It’s not the type of thing that gets a lot of notice and hosannas. It’s a simple security update: boring but nevertheless vital. That makes it all the more worthy of our thanks.

Ihor Radchenko <a href="https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-orgmode/2024-03/msg00563.html">announced</a> that there’s a corresponding update to Org mode so be sure to update them both.</p>
