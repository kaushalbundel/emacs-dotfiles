<p>I am working on rousing the <a href="https://harelang.org">Hare</a> community to get the
word out about our work. I have drafted the <a href="https://harelang.org/evangelism/">Hare evangelism</a> guidelines to
this effect, which summarizes how we want to see our community bringing Hare to
more people.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d like to spread the word in a way which is respectful of the attention of
others &ndash; we&rsquo;re explicitly eschewing unsolicited prompts for projects to
consider writing/rewriting in Hare, as well as any paid sponsorships or
advertising. Blog posts about Hare, videos, participating in (organic) online
discussions &ndash; much better! And one idea we have is to talk about Hare on
podcasts which might be interested in the project.</p>
<p>If that describes your podcast, here&rsquo;s my bold request: can I make an
appearance?</p>
<p>Here are some mini &ldquo;press kits&rdquo; to give you a hook and some information that
might be useful for preparing an interview.</p>
<h2 id="the-hare-programming-language">The Hare programming language</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Hare is a systems programming language designed to be simple, stable, and
robust. Hare uses a static type system, manual memory management, and a
minimal runtime. It is well-suited to writing operating systems, system tools,
compilers, networking software, and other low-level, high performance tasks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hare has been in development since late 2019 and today has about 100
contributors.</p>

<p>Ares is an operating system written in Hare which is under development. It
features a micro-kernel oriented design and runs on x86_64 and aarch64. Its
design is inspired by the seL4 micro-kernel and Plan 9.</p>

<h2 id="himitsu-a-secret-storage-system">Himitsu: a secret storage system</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Himitsu is a secure secret storage system for Unix-like systems. It provides
an arbitrary key/value store (where values may be secret) and a query language
for manipulating the key store.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Himitsu is written in Hare.</p>
