<p><strong>TLDR: WATCH THE VIDEO (click above)</strong></p><p>If you&#8217;re driving product innovation at a company, you have a lot of ways to do it:</p><p>&#9989; Talking to users</p><p>&#9989; Doing market research</p><p>&#9989; A/B testing &amp; iterating</p><p>But there&#8217;s another way, too, where success is baked in: aligning product development with <strong>existing user behaviors</strong>. This approach isn't just about listening to <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/kristen_berman_don_t_listen_to_your_customers_do_this_instead">what users say</a>; it's about deeply understanding and responding to <strong>what they actually do</strong>.</p><p><strong>Use case 1:</strong> <strong>'Save For Later'</strong></p><p>Slack users have been marking messages as<em> unread</em> to save them for later. The formal 'Save for Later' feature just lets people do the same thing&#8212;but in an easier way.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Use case 2: 'Huddles'</strong></p><p>Users were already finding ways to collaborate in real-time; Slack recognized this and gave them a more structured, efficient way to do it. And a 'Huddle' doesn&#8217;t sound like a &#8216;meeting&#8217;; it's a casual, quick, drop-in interaction that resonates with Slack's ethos.</p><p><strong>Use case 3:</strong>&nbsp; <strong>Peloton&#8217;s 'Stacking'</strong></p><p>Peloton noticed users were manually combining classes to create longer workouts. The Stacking feature just encourages people to combine classes in a more seamless way. They made it easier to do the thing that people were already doing. </p><p>This seems like a &#8216;duh&#8217; (<em>of course</em> users adopt features built this way!), but consider how long you were trying to bookmark messages before Slack made this easier for you with a feature. Years! Then the question becomes: how can we pay attention to user behaviors and <strong>design for them sooner</strong>? At Irrational Labs and in the behavioral science world, we have a repeatable format for uncovering these insights. It&#8217;s called a <a href="https://irrationallabs.com/download-behavioral-design-guide/">behavioral diagnosis</a>. We study what people do&#8212;and we build features based on these insights.</p><p><strong>3 things I cover in this teardown:</strong></p><p><strong>&#128161; </strong>How to align product development with <strong>existing user behavior</strong></p><p>&#128161; How to <strong>create a mental model</strong> for the key behavior you&#8217;re trying to achieve while also <strong>putting your stamp on it</strong></p><p>&#128161; How to <strong>amplify that behavior</strong> by exposing users to it who weren&#8217;t doing it already</p><p>I&#8217;m curious: what are some behaviors you&#8217;ve adopted in your daily app usage that you wish had a dedicated feature? Share your thoughts&#8212;we&#8217;ll explore the intersection of user behavior and product design again next time.</p><div class="native-video-embed" data-component-name="VideoPlaceholder" data-attrs="{&quot;mediaUploadId&quot;:&quot;d881db2d-f014-44d9-86e9-1430fa30d05f&quot;,&quot;duration&quot;:null}"></div><p><em><strong>Have a friend who would enjoy these teardowns?
