<p><em>Hello! I&#8217;m back here after an unintentionally long break, with lots more opinions carefully couched in &#8220;research&#8221;. I notice that I&#8217;ve gained a few new subscribers here. Welcome, and I must say, I admire your optimism, given that my last newsletter was in May. You all are proof of the human penchant for holding on to hope in the face of mounting evidence for despair. May your hope be fulfilled.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>I have a few new posts partially written and will release them soon. The next edition will be on the phenomenon of the aspirational travel photograph, and should be up by next week. In the meanwhile though, I made the new logo of the wonderful newsletter <a href="https://womenlead.substack.com/">#WomenLead</a> that you really ought to subscribe to if you haven&#8217;t already. It&#8217;s curated by the smart, kind, extremely cool <a href="https://twitter.com/akshichawla">Akshi Chawla</a>, and Akshi let me write about the logo design process on #WomenLead itself. The post is up now, and the first paragraph and the link to it is below.</em></p><div><hr></div><p></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb5faf1ab-9cbf-4fa5-98be-c4e478652ac0_1600x791.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb5faf1ab-9cbf-4fa5-98be-c4e478652ac0_1600x791.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb5faf1ab-9cbf-4fa5-98be-c4e478652ac0_1600x791.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb5faf1ab-9cbf-4fa5-98be-c4e478652ac0_1600x791.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb5faf1ab-9cbf-4fa5-98be-c4e478652ac0_1600x791.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb5faf1ab-9cbf-4fa5-98be-c4e478652ac0_1600x791.png" width="1456" height="720" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b5faf1ab-9cbf-4fa5-98be-c4e478652ac0_1600x791.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:720,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:32849,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb5faf1ab-9cbf-4fa5-98be-c4e478652ac0_1600x791.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb5faf1ab-9cbf-4fa5-98be-c4e478652ac0_1600x791.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb5faf1ab-9cbf-4fa5-98be-c4e478652ac0_1600x791.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb5faf1ab-9cbf-4fa5-98be-c4e478652ac0_1600x791.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>I was thrilled when Akshi agreed to let me design #WomenLead&#8217;s logo, because I&#8217;ve been a longtime reader and admirer and so, in a sense, I was also designing it for myself. The tone of #WomenLead is pitched perfectly towards a no-nonsense, smart and inclusive idea of feminism. Week after week, Akshi highlights the grinding work that women around the world do as they take one step forward and often two steps back on the slow march towards equality.
