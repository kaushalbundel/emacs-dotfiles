<p>This is an entry from my journal.</p>

<hr />

<p>I spent the afternoon sitting at a small, wooden, half-broken table I
have. I took the opportunity to sunbathe and relax. Too much work
detracts from the capacity to be productive. The autumn sun is still
warm, though the wind is already feeling cold. No-one passed by. This
year’s vintage is probably over. I will not be seeing any labourers
until early spring, when they will come to prune the vineyards. It is
quiet here. The nearby village does attract visitors. The fields are
tranquil regardless: just some farmers and wild animals.</p>

<p>There are a million things I could complain about despite being in
this otherwise peaceful place. Why must my daily showers be so cold?
At what point do salads lose their flavour? And what is the point of
spending these fulfilling moments alone? Humans have a bottomless
capacity for ungratefulness. God gave us the garden of Eden and all we
could do with it is find a reason to complain by asking for more.</p>

<p>I cannot completely forgo this ungrateful aspect of my humanity. I
cannot become a non-human human. For as long as I have this presence,
I will live with all it entails, cherishing what I like while
tolerating what I dislike.</p>

<p>We don’t get to pick our presence: to be human is to have a bit of
everything germane to humankind. All the archetypes are present, in
different proportions and combinations. The poet will thus correctly
point out that while there is Aphrodite, in all her beauty, she is
standing beside the ever-bellicose Aris. We will never be completely
identified with these or other such archetypes, but only exhibit
aspects of them.</p>

<p>Ambiguity disturbs us. We seek clear guidelines and wish to have
indelible lines delineating the boundaries between good and evil. Yet
the world is one of admixture. Ideals are analytical constructs, which
exist in their pure form <em>in vitro</em>. In practice, however, in our <em>in
vivo</em> experience, we have to deal with uncertainty, relying on
imperfect knowledge, while labouring in complex arrangements of
indeterminate factors. All dogmas assume the form of “do this no
matter what” while we know how most of our experience unfolds within
the confines of “it depends”.</p>

<p>The million complaints I have extend to our shared humanity. Why must
there be bullies, tyrants, rapists, bigots, warlords, traffickers, and
so on? Why can’t we all just get along as equals? I have no answer;
none that I can prove, anyway. Maybe there is a grand reason and we
have to trust the process. Or maybe the reality is ugly.</p>

<p>I do not complain though. Not about my humanity nor the prevailing
conditions in my immediate milieu. Rather, I have learnt to find the
universal in the common things. Instead of the numerous reasons to be
negative about, I am content with what I have. If I have more, I am
fine. If I have less, I am fine. Not because I do not exhibit
preferences. No! As a human, I do have preferences and always wish for
the best. Rather, I recognise how powerless I am to affect the
workings of the cosmos. I pursue my goals conscious of the fact that
my stratagems are a heap of leaves in this November wind.</p>

<p>My modus vivendi rests on acceptance of the human condition. I have no
delusions about people, myself included. As a physically fit male, I
know I have the capacity to be aggressive and to confront even the
fiercest of animals in combat, given the right triggers. Whether I
actually express that is beside the point: the potential is there. As
a son, I am inherently biased in favour of my parents, even tough I
know the perils of bias. As a rational agent, I recognise the
practical benefits of being methodical and contemplative. Though I
cannot be purely reasonable. There are sensations that require a
different faculty altogether; sensations which are felt at the
emotional level. Reducing those to rational terms is exactly that:
reducing. In short, I have accepted that I am a bit of everything in
potentiality. There is a mind and a body as facets of a singular
presence. I am well-meaning and eager to help, though I know all too
well that humanity has an inexhaustible capacity for inhumanity.</p>

<p>I am inclined towards benevolence. This, I think, is my natural
disposition. At the conscious level, it also is what I consider right.
Though I would be fooling myself if I claimed that I do whatever I
want, contrary to what my nature renders feasible. We give too much
value to our schemes, while our culture makes us think that we can do
anything we set our mind to. This tiger within, however, hugs us
continuously and its claws are razor sharp. As such, I have neither
high nor low hopes about me and us. We simply are the way we are. I
try to push us in what I believe is the right direction, by carrying
out the deeds, not by uttering big words, though I honestly cannot
tell if my path is the correct one. I have not yet reached its
terminus. How am I supposed to know? Those who claim to have all the
answers are fools.</p>

<p>Of course, I can pretend to be purely rational or perfectly loving. It
would fit the persona of the hermit philosopher, I guess. Everything
is a brand nowadays, so why not this too? A captivating ad with a
glittering logo. Add some “-isms” to the mix to sound profound. The
package is ready to be marketed… They teach us too many books and
too little life. Lots of people choose such a pretentious course of
action, thinking they are too clever to deal with the world of
admixture like the rest of us. Yet they are still human and, as such,
are bound to suffer from the unsustainable contradiction between their
designs and natural outlook.</p>

<p>Let us be honest about who we are. Only then can we aspire to our
highest while working to improve upon—or ameliorate the effect
of—our lowest. If I assume to be incorruptible, then why bother
taking preventive action against corruption? The frailties of the
human character are there. Only after recognising them will we be
ready to face them.</p>

<p>The body is a source of pleasure but also of pain. It generates
attraction, while it can cause repulsion. So it is good or bad? Such
dichotomy is misleading, as it wants to treat the body as an optional
magnitude. Suppose it is bad, despicable even. So what? We cannot live
a human life without it. The distinction is not actionable. As for
living a life to prepare for the eventual emancipation from the body,
this too is not a way of escaping it in the here and now: we must
still feed it, feel the pain, experience the passions, et cetera.</p>

<p>I am not a advocate for absurdity. I do care about reasonableness and
for it to be practical at that. I simply recognise there is more to
humanity than reason. I have yet to find a perfect dictionary entry
for “love”, for example. I also have no words to describe its full
extent. Yet I have known it since as far as I can remember. How do you
rationalise and then verbalise in full that which you recognise only
once you feel it?</p>

<p>Back to the quietude of this place. I choose not to complain about
anything. It simply is. Will it get better or worse? How am I supposed
to know? Will I feel good or bad about it? My feelings are ultimately
irrelevant. When I am happy, I thank God for showing me what happiness
is. When I suffer, I thank God for teaching me what misery is. Whether
divinity actually exists is irrelevant. Mine is a figure of speech
that may resonate with sometihng greater than me. What matters is that
at all times I accept what is and admit to my powerlessness in the
grand scheme of things.</p>

<p>All I can do, then, is work with what I have to achieve what feels
like a sustainable local arrangement: a balance between the various
facets of my being. I shall not treat some of them as inherently
undesirable. Nothing in nature is useless. Why would some facet of
humanity be an exception?</p>

<p>I have learnt not to place a disproportionate value on cleverness. I
don’t need to appear smart to anyone. What I aspire to as a
philosopher (i.e. “friend of wisdom”) is to be more wise. Perhaps I
will then smile in the face of this cosmic admixture and utter these
words as I look skyward: “you know better”. Maybe it will be on
another day like this one and I will decide to sing with the birds.
What’s the point of singing? Who knows?</p>
