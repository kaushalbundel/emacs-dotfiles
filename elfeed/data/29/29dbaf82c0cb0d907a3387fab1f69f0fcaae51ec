<p><strong>TLDR: WATCH THE VIDEO (click above)</strong></p><p>Imagine you're in the hospital with the flu. Well, not you, but my dad. He recovers, heads home, and then the bill arrives. Cue the dramatic music: it's $1,000. Hold up&#8212;outrage ensues! He has Medicare! He has insurance! I'm ready to spend hours on the phone, but then... we dive into the details, and the plot thickens.</p><p>Finally, it dawns on us. That $1,000? It&#8217;s less than 1% of the bill. Insurance already paid 99% &#8211; $123,000! Without digging through the fine print, we&#8217;d never have known about this act of financial heroism. Talk about a missed marketing opportunity.</p><p>This got me thinking about the broader healthcare context, through the lens of  <a href="https://www.mychart.org/">MyChart</a>. So in today&#8217;s teardown, we take on <strong>how information is presented</strong>, <strong>framing effects</strong> and <strong>transparency</strong>, and what this can teach <strong>HR managers</strong> and <strong>PMs</strong>.&nbsp;</p><h2>Framing effects: The lens we view our bills through</h2><p>How information is framed can drastically alter our perception and decision-making processes. In the context of my dad's hospital bill, the insurance company's decision to foreground the <strong>amount owed</strong> rather than the <strong>amount covered</strong> is a textbook case of negative framing. This buries the lead: the relatively small amount left for the patient to pay overshadows the insurance company's financial contribution (in my case, a whopping $123,000).</p><p>So much for the perceived value of the insurance coverage! Perhaps worse, this framing also misses a chance to foster a positive patient-insurance relationship. Think about it: by flipping the script and leading with the 99% coverage, the insurance could turn a <strong>moment of potential frustration</strong> into one of <strong>gratitude and trust-building</strong>. It's a small shift in presentation that totally changes the narrative. Suddenly, instead of financial burden, it&#8217;s about support and care.</p><h2>Don&#8217;t hide your effort, show it</h2><p>The idea of framing extends to the <strong>entire healthcare experience</strong>. How procedures are explained, options are presented, and outcomes are described&#8212;all are subject to framing effects that can influence patient choices and satisfaction. Recognizing and intentionally managing these effects can lead to more informed decision-making, better patient experiences, and ultimately, a healthcare system that feels more aligned with patient needs and perspectives.</p><p>And the lessons aren&#8217;t limited to healthcare. A <a href="https://www.hbs.edu/ris/Publication%20Files/14-034_16ccb2b4-1a24-47b5-8bcf-dca2720bb96f.pdf">study by Ryan Buell, Ethan Porter, and Michael Norton</a> found that Bostonians who interacted with a website that showed both service requests (e.g., potholes, broken street lamps) and what the city was doing to address those requests became 14% more trusting and 12% more supportive. This is huge. You can improve your relationship with your <strong>customers or employees</strong> &#8211; just by <strong>showing them your effort</strong>. &#128161;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F78e16030-0801-49a0-894a-82d30de7410d_1616x1340.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F78e16030-0801-49a0-894a-82d30de7410d_1616x1340.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F78e16030-0801-49a0-894a-82d30de7410d_1616x1340.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F78e16030-0801-49a0-894a-82d30de7410d_1616x1340.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F78e16030-0801-49a0-894a-82d30de7410d_1616x1340.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F78e16030-0801-49a0-894a-82d30de7410d_1616x1340.png" width="1456" height="1207" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/78e16030-0801-49a0-894a-82d30de7410d_1616x1340.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1207,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1227286,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F78e16030-0801-49a0-894a-82d30de7410d_1616x1340.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F78e16030-0801-49a0-894a-82d30de7410d_1616x1340.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F78e16030-0801-49a0-894a-82d30de7410d_1616x1340.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F78e16030-0801-49a0-894a-82d30de7410d_1616x1340.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><em>Screenshots from the Citizen&#8217;s Connect application in the baseline and operationally transparent conditions (Study 1) (<a href="https://www.hbs.edu/ris/Publication%20Files/14-034_16ccb2b4-1a24-47b5-8bcf-dca2720bb96f.pdf">Source: Buell, Porter, Norton</a>).</em></figcaption></figure></div><p><strong>3 key insights from this teardown:</strong></p><p>&#128444;&#65039; Why <strong>framing matters</strong> more than you think</p><p>&#128270; How <strong>transparency</strong> can transform perception</p><p>&#128483;&#65039; Why you should <strong>show your customers</strong> what you&#8217;re doing for them</p><p>Reflecting on the billing experience with my dad, it's clear that insurers and the healthcare industry as a whole can do better at sharing financial information.</p><p>I&#8217;ll frame it like this: it&#8217;s not about blaming anyone &#8211; it&#8217;s about finding opportunities to enhance patient experience.
