<p>An <a href="https://www.existentialhope.com/podcasts/progress-an-ever-evolving-journey">interview with Foresight</a> for their Existential Hope library.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Jason envisages a future marked by dynamic, continuous progress, encapsulated in the concept of protopia. This vision diverges from a traditional notion of a utopia, and instead embraces a reality of constant, incremental improvement. In Jason’s view, progress is a journey, not a destination. It’s a series of small, significant steps that, over time, lead to profound transformations in our world.</p>

  <p>Central to Jason’s perspective is the transformative potential of AI, paralleling historical technological leaps like the steam engine and personal computing. He views AI as a catalyst for a new era in human history, one that could redefine societal structures by making high-quality services accessible to a broader demographic. This democratization of resources, akin to services becoming as affordable as a Netflix subscription, could bridge societal gaps. However, Jason emphasizes that this protopian future requires collective agency, responsibility, and a balanced understanding of our role in shaping it. He believes that progress accelerates over time, with each innovation building upon the last, thus speeding up future advancements.</p>

<p>This is a talk I’ve given before. This recording has subtitles in Portuguese for what that’s worth. The question period begins <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/4QTxifMki5A?si=-GdY3QptpHwGFE22&amp;t=1907">about 31 minutes in</a>.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.csmonitor.com/World/2023/1222/Pessimism-or-progress-What-did-you-see-in-2023">2023 year-in-review piece</a> in which I am briefly quoted:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>… 2023 was the year millions of people first used a generative AI program (such as ChatGPT), the next great platform for economic productivity. Though too soon to assess its impact, AI has the potential to become as powerful a change agent as the internal combustion engine, mass manufacturing, electricity, and computing itself, says Jason Crawford, a technology historian and founder of The Roots of Progress. “In the most extreme scenario, which I still think is pretty speculative but not impossible, it is the next big thing in human history – after agriculture and the Industrial Revolution.”</p>
