<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ef-themes</code> is a collection of light and dark themes for GNU Emacs
whose goal is to provide colourful (“pretty”) yet legible options for
users who want something with a bit more flair than the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">modus-themes</code>
(also designed by me).</p>

<h2>Experience the “Melissa” variants</h2>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ef-melissa-dark</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ef-melissa-light</code> are the new members of
the Ef themes collection. They form a pair of warmly coloured palettes
that have a strong emphasis on yellow hues against a soft background.
In my opinion, these themes (as well as the “Elea” and “Maris”
variants) are best used when environmental light is neither too
intense nor too dim.</p>

<p>The blog post where I announced these new themes and showed screen
shots of them: <a href="https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2023-10-04-ef-melissa-dark-light/">https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2023-10-04-ef-melissa-dark-light/</a>.</p>

<p>Screen shots for the entire collection are available on my website:
<a href="https://protesilaos.com/emacs/ef-themes-pictures">https://protesilaos.com/emacs/ef-themes-pictures</a>.</p>

<p>There now are 28 themes in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ef-themes</code> package, covering a broad
range of preferences and needs. They all are highly legible (typically
well above the WCAG AA standard) and very customisable (consult their
manual).</p>

<h2>Use palette overrides instead of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ef-themes-region</code></h2>

<p>The user option <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ef-themes-region</code> is no more. It used to provide an
intense variant to the region highlight colour. I am discontinuing
this as the themes have a powerful mechanism of overriding any entry
in their palette, with the benefit of semantic colour mappings, to
affect the style of the theme.</p>

<p>Palette overrides exist for each theme, but also as a common variable,
with the former taking precedence. A theme-specific variable looks
like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ef-summer-palette-overrides</code> while the common variable is
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ef-themes-common-palette-overrides</code>. Preview palette entries with the
command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ef-themes-preview-colors</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ef-themes-preview-colors-current</code>.</p>

<p>The manual describes all the details, though here is a simple snippet
to change the region of all themes to an intense yellow colour with an
equally pronounced foreground (i.e. overriding the colour of any
underlying text):</p>

<div class="language-elisp highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">;; Evaluate and then reload the theme for changes to take effect.  Use</span>
<span class="c1">;; the command `ef-themes-preview-colors' to discover the names of</span>
<span class="c1">;; palette entries to override/remap.</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="k">setq</span> <span class="nv">ef-themes-common-palette-overrides</span>
      <span class="o">'</span><span class="p">((</span><span class="nv">bg-region</span> <span class="nv">bg-yellow-intense</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">fg-region</span> <span class="nv">fg-intense</span><span class="p">)))</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2>Git commit messages have more refined warnings</h2>

<p>While composing a Git commit message with either the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">magit</code> package
or the built-in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vc-git</code>, the summary line can display text in a
different colour to denote that it exceeds a certain character limit.
Such a limit is a convention to keep logs readable, though it is not
an error per se.</p>

<p>The Ef themes used to apply a background to those warnings, though
they now use only a foreground. The reason is that the styles I have
picked are carefully designed to be unambiguous, without needing to
exaggerate their mutual differences.</p>

<h2>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">breadcrumb</code> package uses appropriate styles</h2>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">breadcrumb</code> is a new contribution by João Távora:
<a href="https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/breadcrumb.html">https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/breadcrumb.html</a>. It displays
information about the context of the current code form or document
heading in either the mode line or the header line. The styles it uses
are now consistent with the aesthetics of each of the Ef themes.</p>

<h2>Theme metadata for new Emacs versions is as intended</h2>

<p>This is about the very definition of each theme item, in order to
support new features in Emacs where themes can specify the set they
belong to, as well as whether they are light or dark. The built-in
command that leverages this facility <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">theme-choose-variant</code>. Though
users of the Ef themes may prefer the commands <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ef-themes-select</code>,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ef-themes-toggle</code> (if the user option <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ef-themes-to-toggle</code> is
configured), <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ef-themes-load-random</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ef-themes-select-dark</code>,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ef-themes-select-light</code>.</p>

<p>This is in response to Emacs bug#65468:
