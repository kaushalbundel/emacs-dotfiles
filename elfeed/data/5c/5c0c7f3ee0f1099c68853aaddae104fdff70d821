There were two competing slates of candidates, the &#8220;San Francisco Democrats for Change&#8221; slate (associated with the political coalition the San Francisco media dubs &#8220;moderate&#8221;) and the &#8220;Labor and Working Families&#8221; slate, (usually dubbed &#8220;progressive.)

(In my experience, the &#8220;SF progressive&#8221; coalition was basically on the upwards march for roughly 2016-2020, and has had a rough go of it in the elections since then. Mayor Breed&#8217;s election in 2018 was the closest the SF Progressives had come to winning the Mayor&#8217;s office since 1992.)</p></li><li><p>When you parse individual races, you&#8217;ll notice that money spent does not correlate very well at all with results.

<a href="https://missionlocal.org/2024/01/san-francisco-liberals-san-francisco-progressives/">Joe Eskanazi,</a> Editor in Chief of Mission Local</p><p>Joe is another person who I disagree with often but who I nonetheless have a lot of affection for, but I just think he is dead wrong here. San Francisco just voted 70% for an affordable housing bond and 73% for California Proposition 1, a <s>$8 billion</s> $6.8 billion mental health bond. San Francisco voters routinely approve tax increases to fund transit, housing, education, and so on. Even our &#8220;law and order&#8221; ballot measures were significantly more nuanced than the media narrative would have you believe. Proposition E&#8217;s critics pointed to it allowing police officers to engage in more vehicular pursuits and expanded the use of drones, but failed to note that it specifically authorized the use of drones <em>as an alternative to vehicular pursuits. </em>Proposition F&#8217;s critics declared it to be mandatory drug testing for welfare scheme copied from Ron DeSantis, but failed to note the distinction between a program that <em>allowed you to stay on benefits if you agreed to treatment </em>versus a program that straight up cut you off. I personally supported E (with a lot of qualms) and opposed F, but I think it&#8217;s misleading to characterize San Francisco voters as closet reactionaries&#8212;even the policies that people brand the most &#8220;reactionary&#8221; have to work in a lot of San Francisco specific nuance to win over our voters.</p><p><strong>Theory #3: San Franciscans are progressives who want results</strong></p><p>&#8220;The electorate hasn&#8217;t changed, it&#8217;s just that elected officials have stopped doing their jobs well.&#8221;</p><p>&#8212; GrowSF co-founder Steven Buss&nbsp;</p><p>&#8220;San Franciscans want to make sure our streets are safe,&#8221; she said. &#8220;They want better public education. They want a government that works. When did those stop being Democratic values?&#8221;</p><p>&#8212; Nancy Tung, victorious DCCC candidate<br><br>The argument, articulated well by <a href="https://sfstandard.com/2024/03/09/the-media-narrative-is-wrong-san-francisco-progressives-actually-won-on-election-night/">Lee Edwards in the SF Standard, </a>is that while San Francisco&#8217;s ideology hasn&#8217;t changed, but that the voters are trading in grandstanding progressive declarations for tangible progressive results. While this is the sort of broad cliched proclamation you could honestly make in every election here, I think it rings the most true. San Francisco has been dysfunctional in its governance for a very long time, but two major shifts have brought that dysfunction to the forefront.</p><p>The 2010s tech boom made the city&#8217;s dysfunctional housing approval process to forefront of our politics: While the surge in rents birthed the San Francisco YIMBY movement, politically speaking I&#8217;d argue its most immediate short run impact was to boost the fortunes of San Francisco&#8217;s &#8220;progressives.&#8221; In a functioning city, a surge in economic growth would lead to a surge in housing, but because we are not a functioning city, the wave of money that flooded into San Francisco hit the hard constraints of our byzantine permitting process. This resulted in skyrocketing evictions and rents, and the SF Moderate coalition, under Mayor Ed Lee, took much of the blame.</p><p>The pandemic brought our dysfunctional public safety and education systems to the forefront of our politics: San Francisco&#8217;s school board elections have traditionally been a fairly inside baseball affair, because the percentage of San Franciscans with kids is famously small. However, the pandemic meant that a particularly ideological school board was left to handle a particularly fraught situation, and the results were&#8230;not pretty. General frustration with school closures and remote learning boiled over when board members generated national headlines over school renaming efforts denouncing Abraham Lincoln and bizarre tweets stoking racial resentment towards Asian-American students.&nbsp; The voters got the message that San Francisco&#8217;s educators had priortized ideology over their kids&#8217; education and they didn&#8217;t like it, which is why the School Board recall succeeded with 70%+ of the vote and a ballot proposition urging SFUSD to reverse its removal of 8th Grade Algebra passed with 80%+ of the vote. This has been very damaging for the reputation of San Francisco&#8217;s &#8220;progressive&#8221; coalition.</p><p>The pandemic, of course, also skyrocketed voter concerns about public safety. There&#8217;s a lot more I want to say about this, but this piece is already long, so for now what I&#8217;d like to say is the dynamic here is very similar to what happened with education. San Francisco elected a uniquely ideological District Attorney&#8212;Chesa Boudin, who became a national symbol of criminal justice reform&#8212;just as the pandemic made public safety concerns incredibly salient for voters. The juxtaposition of a District Attorney pushing progressive criminal justice reforms and a surge in crime sent voters the strong message that SF Progressives were more interested in redeeming criminals than keeping old Chinese grandmothers safe from getting their heads bashed in. Do I think this perception is entirely fair? Of course not. But is it how voters feel? Absolutely.<br><br>The politics of housing, education, and public safety have morphed and transmuted a lot since those initial inflection points&#8212;housing is an issue where the growth of the YIMBY movement now gives SF &#8220;moderates&#8221; an edge, education is less about kicking the crazies out and more about trying to deliver tangible results, and public safety is about fentanyl and general feelings of public disorder more so than assaults and robberies&#8212;but taken together, they reflect an electorate deeply frustrated with grand ideological visions and hungry for better nuts and bolts of governance.</p><p>So if you want to know what happened in San Francisco, that&#8217;s my take&#8211;if you want to know what&#8217;s going to happen, tune in next time!</p><div><hr></div><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.noahpinion.blog/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/what-just-happened-in-san-francisco?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/what-just-happened-in-san-francisco?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p>
