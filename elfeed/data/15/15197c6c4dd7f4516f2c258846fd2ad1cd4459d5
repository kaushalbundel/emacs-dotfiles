Hey Crafters!
</p>

 <p>
I have a new teammate on the Crafted Emacs project, Judy ( <a href="https://github.com/jvdydev">@jvdydev</a>) is now a co-maintainer!  I am so excited to be working with her on this project.  It has been a while since I posted an update, but there is continuing work on Crafted Emacs, and now with Judyâ€™s help, even more is being accomplished!  See my  <a href="https://write.as/jeffbowman/crafted-emacs-update-for-july-and-new-teammate">blog post</a> to get all the juicy bits! 
</p>

 <p>
Happy Crafting!
