<p>I am participating at this yearâ€™s EmacsConf. The event takes place
this weekend: <a href="https://emacsconf.org/2023/talks/">https://emacsconf.org/2023/talks/</a>.</p>

<p>My talk is about <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hyperdrive.el</code>, a peer-to-peer filesystem in Emacs.
I am co-presenting it with Joseph Turner. More information here:
<a href="https://emacsconf.org/2023/talks/hyperdrive/">https://emacsconf.org/2023/talks/hyperdrive/</a>.</p>

<p>Make sure to tune in for the conference. All the presentations are
interesting and it is nice for us to come together as a community.</p>

<p>The hyperdrive video plays during my evening local time. I am
available to join live, though I do not know yet if my electricity
setup will have enough power left by then (usually I am without power
after ~20:30). It depends on the weather. If all goes well, I will be
there.</p>

<p>Good luck to everyone involved!</p>
