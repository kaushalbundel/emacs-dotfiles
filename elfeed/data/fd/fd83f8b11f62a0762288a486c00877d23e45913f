Even if you figure out the right pricing, delivering this and managing ops will eat into margins. However, a small market could be created by building special foods that are mixed with the regular food to solve for milk production.<br><strong><br>Solve insurance for high value cattle </strong>- this is a huge problem. If you scout the Animall website, you will find cattle worth few lakh rupees too. The average price point however is ~&#8377;30,000 to &#8377;50,000. The overall unorganized cattle insurance market is a category creation play. This is a place where the first real cross sell for Animall could happen.<br><br><strong>Solve access to credit for cattle purchase </strong>- this is the most &#8220;need&#8221; product in this whole value chain of purchasing a cattle for milk production. The problem though is how underwriting for such loans would work. This means the loans need to be given with insurance &amp; will always be short tenure (less than 3 years loans). If under writing is figured for farmers with little to no access to credit scores - this could itself become the biggest revenue source.<br><br><strong>Marketplace for artificial insemination </strong>- this is today done through brokers and family/ friends network. It limits the possibility of getting insemination from top breeds sellers which farmers do not have access to. Animall could become that digital supply marketplace where the purchase and delivery of artificial insemination could happen. Again, this will need specific bets and is going to be a full stack solution &amp; comes with ops - something the company is already burning money with.<br><br><strong>Solve vaccination needs post purchase </strong>- this is today done by the local vet. But a full stack solution from credit &#8594; insurance &#8594; vaccination could complete the full lifecycle of the purchase. But, I wouldn&#8217;t put a lot of focus on vaccination considering the thin margins.</p><div><hr></div><h3>These opportunities can only work with &#8220;Trust&#8221;.</h3><p>Farmers need to trust the platform more than their traditional brokers.
