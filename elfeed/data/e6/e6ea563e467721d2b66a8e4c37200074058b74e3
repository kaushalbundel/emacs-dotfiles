Hey Crafters!
</p>

 <p>
I have created the  <a href="https://github.com/SystemCrafters/crafted-emacs/tree/craftedv2beta">Crafted Emacs v2 Beta branch</a>!  There has been a lot of work to make it as stable as possible to get to this point, and while there is still work to be done, I feel the project has made it far enough along to get a new “release”.  Please see the README on the site for information on the project, and my  <a href="https://write.as/jeffbowman/crafted-emacs-v2-beta">blog post</a> announcing this release!
</p>

 <p>
Happy Crafting!
