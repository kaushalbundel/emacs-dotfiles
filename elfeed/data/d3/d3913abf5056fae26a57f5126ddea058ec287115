<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>On windy days
pine trees sing
the song of seas

No matter the place
the heart will travel
to distant shores

Enter the nascent grove
where secrets are told
and follow the rhythm

With each wave
new life forms emerge
as others wash away

Find trees and seas
witness transfiguration anew
and dance to their beat
