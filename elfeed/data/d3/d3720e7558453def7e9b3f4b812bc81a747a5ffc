<p>In this ~27 minute video, I show my progress on two different projects
at my hut. The first is about the clearing of a wild spot where I will
plant cypress trees at. These trees will protect from the strong
northern winds. The second project is about the hut itself: I am
producing more concrete to patch the parts of the walls that still
leak water.</p>
