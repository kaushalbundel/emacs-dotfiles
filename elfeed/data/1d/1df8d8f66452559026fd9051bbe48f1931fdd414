<p>There is a fashion, among men, for workout programs that consist exclusively of heavy compound lifts, focusing on the legs more than the arms. This leads to men who have large gams and relatively slim upper bodies. The goal is large amounts of functional strength, shunning aesthetics.</p><p>Personally this is not my goal. I like being functionally strong, but I also like having pretty arms and shoulders. And I get better results at the gym when I don&#8217;t pretend otherwise. I feel more enjoyment, and work harder, when I think, &#8220;aha, here I am, producing a more chiseled figure that I will be pleased to inhabit,&#8221; and fit in vanity-focused dumbbell stuff in with the big barbell lifts.&nbsp;</p><p>Shunning aesthetics doesn&#8217;t mean you are focusing on what is practical. It means you are ignoring aesthetics, which is a highly practical subject. For most people, it is simply a hallucination to believe that squatting 300+lbs is more functional than looking good and squatting 200lbs. At a certain point you are strong enough to do everything you want to, but perhaps haven&#8217;t maxed out potential social returns to being attractive. Lifting has made life physically easier for me, but given the enormous utility of marrying well, I&#8217;m going to say that being less scrawny has been the main advantage.&nbsp;</p><p>Okay, sure: There is a hazard here of being lost in a world of appearances, forever making yourself miserable by comparing your body to an ideal. But as the kids say, this is a skill issue&#8212;much like learning to be a gourmand without constantly overeating, or learning to dress well within a budget. There is a way to enjoy the game of appearances, to play your hand as well as possible without losing sight of more important things, or falling into an ego-hell of constant comparison.</p><p>This point goes beyond physical fitness. When I coach creative people, I sometimes hear things like, &#8220;I feel bad that I&#8217;m producing work because I want to look good.&#8221; To which my response is: Why? Do you think great artists don&#8217;t like being sexy and glamorous? Do you think there&#8217;s anything wrong with wanting to be liked and respected? If you make work that people like, and they like you, that represents an increase in worldwide joy. Again, there&#8217;s a balance: Audience capture can disconnect you from the intuitive/emotional foundations of creative work. But, equally, social incentives can serve to coax the muse, and provide motivation to get over the anxiety of public exposure.</p><p>I think there is some element of social gamesmanship going on here. It is low-status to transparently demand attention, and not offer anything in return for the attention demanded. And it&#8217;s high-status for attention-getting acts to seem natural and easy. Oh, I just woke up this way. I just dashed off this love poem in a few minutes. It just so happens that my internet stream of consciousness is witty and well-considered. These casual photos on my Instagram just happen to make me look beautiful.</p><p>You could be fooled into thinking that these people don&#8217;t <em>really </em>want attention, and thus, if you are taking them as exemplars, you shouldn&#8217;t think about looking good in public. But that is obviously the wrong lesson. Nonchalant attention-getting is only natural in that it evinces the naturalness of mastery. People who do this don&#8217;t want attention less&#8212;they&#8217;re just good at getting it in the quantity and quality they desire.&nbsp;</p><p>Laboring in obscurity, or pretending you don&#8217;t want people to look at you, isn&#8217;t nobler than the alternative. It&#8217;s just bad strategy, assuming that your goals in life involve other people.</p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://sashachapin.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Sasha's 'Newsletter' is a reader-supported publication.
