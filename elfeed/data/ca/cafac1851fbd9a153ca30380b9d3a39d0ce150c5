<p><b><br/></b>Every successful startup requires a proper creation myth, a few embarrassing anecdotes punctuated by a poignant teaching moment or two. In the hands of an enterprising communications professional, a memorable origin story humanizes the founders, and preempts the perennial “how did it all begin” with a clever, if non-controversial, bromide. eBay’s PEZ dispenser sales, Google’s misspelling, Twitter inspired by taxi drivers’ short messages all come to mind. Are they exactly how things happened? Who cares, they are fun, and easy to retell.<b><br/></b></p><p>Affirm is hardly at a point where a carefully crafted origin story is a requirement — it’s the sort of thing you focus on when it’s time for a coming-of-age cover story in a non-industry-specific rag. Nonetheless, here’s one from the pantheon of personal baggage contributing to my motivation towards this crazy goal of making consumer finance a more honest enterprise. </p><p>I was a Computer Science sophomore at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign when two wild and crazy guys named Luke and Scott (wild and crazy by the standards of the University&rsquo;s chapter of the Association of Computing Machinery, where we all met) interrupted my Mountain Dew-fueled bout of late-night programming at the ACM office (with no computer of my own, I took full advantage of school equipment) and proposed I stop wasting time on building neat graphics demos, and join them in an exciting startup adventure. I had no other plans for the evening, and so began my entrepreneurial journey.</p><p>The year was 1994, Mosaic Communications was just founded, and with the front-row seat to the Web supernova (the first graphical browser was built at UIUC by Marc Andreessen and friends) starting a company seemed like a great weekend project, because lack of a personal computer somehow still didn’t result in having much of a social life. </p><p>Fast-forward about a year, and our little startup (SponsorNet New Media — may it virtually rest in peace at the bottom of Huntington Towers in downtown Champaign, IL) was running out of cash. We burned through Scott’s reasonable, Luke’s meager, and my non-existent personal capital in the course of that year, and were now coming up towards the inevitable wall. Multiple fundraising forays proved futile, and our trivial earnings were not enough to keep the server lights on. </p><p>It was around that time that Scott pointed out that I had no credit cards. I was still the proverbial fresh-off-the-boat immigrant (we celebrated my 3rd anniversary in the U.S. that year) and had managed to avoid on-campus credit card pushers through sheer cluelessness. Luke and Scott, on the other hand, were doing a balance transfer every month or two, optimizing their minimum payments, and expanding their access to credit while satisfying our technology purchasing needs. And so I got my first credit card (and the obligatory free t-shirt) during the short walk between my dorm and the Digital Computing Lab.</p><p>As I rang up a sizable balance with my newfound source of cash flow, our startup, fueled in its last throes by that very cash, ran fully aground once and for all. My first startup was dead, long live my next startup. I took over the lease at Huntington Towers, planning to stay in Champaign and graduate, while Luke and Scott set off to the promised land of Palo Alto.</p><p>But even though Mercury, that fickle patron of entrepreneurs, totally flaked out on me (and would do so again and again) his credit was good with me. The twisty path of entrepreneurship was exciting, and I had complete faith that it led to some form of solvency. On the other hand, the good folks at the nameless issuing bank who were so thrilled to give me that $200 line of credit (and the t-shirt) weren&rsquo;t nearly as confident. Perhaps it was the few consecutively missed minimal payments, or my lack of immediate responsiveness to the incessant phone calls from their collection agents, but my limit was promptly reduced to $0, and my naive attempts at getting another card were all unceremoniously denied. </p><p>In 1995 I’d never heard the terms “FICO score” and “credit report”, and had an extremely vague idea of what happens when the largest minimum credit card payment one can afford is $0. By 1996 I was painfully aware of the consequences, and hard at work rebuilding my severely damaged credit score.  </p><p>Dreaming up world-conquering schemes in my spare time, I was doing less exciting, but lucrative, contract work, and paying down my credit card debt. By the time I graduated in 1997, I even had a small, but real win: one of my spare-time projects was acquired by a real Silicon Valley company. Either way, I was no longer in debt — the account was closed, the dreaded card finally cut up.</p><p>This is when I realized my troubles had just begun. Upon moving to Palo Alto soon after graduation, I couldn’t so much as get a cell phone — a friend had to cosign for me at the University Ave Sprint store, and for years caller IDs everywhere announced me as Eric, instead of Max. I slept on Scott’s floor in a 1BR in Palo Alto because no landlord would take me in with “that” credit score. Luke co-signed for my first car loan when Peter [Thiel] demanded I get my own wheels after getting tired of driving me around. </p><p>The embarrassments followed me around for years: having my new “repair-your-credit-by-paying-huge-interest” card declined on a first date, fielding suggestions to consider lesser apartments once I decided to move out of the hospitable floor I called home on Grant Ave. Every year or two, I would decide enough was enough, and I needed to do what I did best: reverse engineer the system that wouldn’t let go of my decade-old mistake, figure out the fastest path to fixing my FICO faux pas, and get the festering over with.</p><p>But there was always something more immediate to do, and the fine print on the statements (and the government info sites) detailing the path of the righteous man through the valley of FICO repair took too long to comprehend in one sitting. Over time, my financial blemishes finally became too distant, and the reactive shudder when hearing “I am just going to need to check your credit” became a mere muscle memory. </p><p>And so exactly 20 years after, nary a payment missed, telling an abridged version of this story to Affirm’s Risk Group, I once again got that familiar “oh no…” feeling when one of the guys offered to look up my current credit score. Honesty is a core value here at Affirm, and so I braced myself for the moment of truth. The answer came back quickly: 764.</p><p>Not bad, not amazing — I’d never qualify for Barclay’s Ring ultra-low 8% APR card (which reportedly requires FICO over 800!), but most banks would be motivated to extend me a pretty good offer of credit at this level. And so here’s that unglamorous, if real, origin story to be stashed away for future PR-department glamorization — it took me 20 years to almost clean up my credit score even though my financial irresponsibility spanned only few months.</p><p>I know I’m not the only one. Every day, recent immigrants are getting denied credit, young people are being persuaded into high-interest credit cards under the guise of 0% offers, and people’s financial lives are getting ruined because of one-time events like illnesses or layoffs. But it doesn’t need to be this way. That frustration and incredulity I had felt toward the credit scoring system remained in the back of my mind until the day when I had the time and resources to fix it. </p><p>We started Affirm to build a nimble, continuously-updated proprietary credit score which will be the engine that allows us to offer credit and financial inclusion to those who learned responsibility the hard way, but did learn it, and acted accordingly, as well as students, immigrants, new families, and many more. And we&rsquo;re just getting started.</p>
