<p>I will work on some of my packages for Emacs. The idea is to spend ~2
hours maintaining <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fontaine</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">spacious-padding</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ef-themes</code>,
and maybe others.</p>

<p>This being a live stream, I will accept any questions in the comments
section and may thus talk about issues not related to the topic of
maintaining the aforementioned packages.</p>

<p><strong>The video will be recorded and can be watched later.</strong></p>
