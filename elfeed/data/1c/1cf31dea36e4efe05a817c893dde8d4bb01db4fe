I read this morning that <a href="https://ny.eater.com/2024/2/14/24072381/david-bouley-death-bouley-montrachet-brushstroke">David Bouley</a> has passed away at
age 70. Bouley was an influential chef in New York city. A huge
influence on the fine dining scene that has developed in the last few
decades.</p>
<p>
Why am I, a retired computer science teacher writing about a decorated
chef? As fate had it, there are some connections between David Bouley
and Stuyvesant High School, specifically the new building, where I
spent most of my career. I started teaching during a teacher shortage,
particularly in math. Actually, had there not been a shortage, I never
would have been given an emergency license and who knows what career
path I would have gone down. This meant that I was younger than most
of the other teachers my departments. Somewhat at Seward and clearly
at Stuy. There was me and Bill in our twenties and most of the rest of
the department were in their upper forties or older. At some point that
switched, and Bill and I were the old farts towards the later stages
of my career.</p>
<p>
I was always a foodie but was never exposed to fine dining. This was
where <a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2014-11-07-rich-rich/">Rich Geller</a> came in. Rich taught calc and ran the math team. He
was also big into fine dining. Bruce Winokur, another much more
experienced math teacher had similar tastes. I don&#39;t remember when but
we ended up going to Bouley&#39;s restaurant &#34;Bouley&#34; - just a couple of
blocks form Stuy for a meal. It was a revelation.</p>
<p>
It turned out that Rich was friends with David Bouley - I think it
just started with him frequenting the restaurant and asking to speak
to the chef and that turned into something of a Stuy math department
connection. We had a biannual tradition - once during the January
regents week and again in June of taking a long lunch at Bouley. Me,
Rich, Bruce, Dawn and a rotating cast of others. And of course going
with Rich meant we always got a few bonus deserts or maybe an extra
course. It was a highlight of the week.</p>
<p>
The Stuy/Bouley connection went further. Rich, as I mentioned ran
Stuy&#39;s math team. In Spring &#39;95 he arranged a special luncheon -
Stuy&#39;s math team at Bouley. If I recall, the entire team was too large
so it was only the seniors. Unfortunately I couldn&#39;t crash the party
but now, many years later, I&#39;m friends with a number of those team
members and it was quite a memorable experience.</p>
<p>
Fast forward to post 9/11. We had been displaced due to the attacks
and had spent a month as guests at Brooklyn Tech. About a month
afterwards, certainly before Halloween, we were back at Stuy. It was
the evening of parent teacher conferences. Usually that evening, the
parents association hosts a dinner for the teachers. It&#39;s cafeteria
style and teachers come and go at various times as long as they make
it to their room by the start of conferences. Usually it&#39;s mostly pot
luck from the parents. Usually pretty tasty and certainly
appreciated. This time, as I went down the line, I said to myself
&#34;Hey, I recognize that beef dishâ€¦&#34; Yep, that meal was catered by
David Bouley and we got many of his on the menu dishes - at least
those that lent themselves to prior preparation and transport to the
school. I don&#39;t know if this was part of his general recovery work (he
did a lot to prepare food for the rescue/recovery workers), if this
was a special arrangement made by Rich or something else but it was
exceptional.</p>
<p>
The years continued as did the regents week lunches. Unfortunately, we
lost Rich to Cancer in the fall of 2011 (tribute post <a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2014-11-07-rich-rich/">here</a>). Shortly before his passing,
David Bouley hosted a reception at Bouley for Rich, his wife Barbara,
his friends, and former students. A touching tribute for a master
teacher.</p>
<p>
Why am I spending all this time about my friend Rich and David Bouley?
Well, it&#39;s about community. Stuy isn&#39;t a neighborhood school. In a
neighborhood or community school, teachers and students see each other
in passing. Not so at Stuy. Only a handful of teachers live in
Manhattan or even the five boroughs. The kids? Many have commutes well
over an hour each way. Yet still, here we had this little foodie math
community at Stuy. Mostly teachers, but students were touched as
well. While we lost Rich over a decade ago, reading about David
Bouley&#39;s death really brought me back.</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve had many fine dining experiences since Rich introduced me to
Bouley&#39;s restaurants. I&#39;ve had great food at Jean George, Daniel, and
Park Avenue Cafe and many others but my meals at Bouley have been
special - the best overall dining experiences. I also remember some
particularly special meals - Rich&#39;s reception. The surprise lunch
for a special graduating senior, when Devorah and I took Jim and Helen
there to thank them for writing the kids college recs and a handful of
others.</p>
<p>
I think that in a lot of cultures there&#39;s a strong tie between food
and community and in this weird little circle community was created
between some CS people, Math people, a specialized high school, and a
great chef.</p>
