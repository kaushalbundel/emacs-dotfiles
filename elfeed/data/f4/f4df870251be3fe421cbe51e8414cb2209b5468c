<p><strong>TLDR: WATCH THE VIDEO (click above)</strong></p><p>If you&#8217;ve ever had insomnia, you know that it tends to perpetuate itself. Couldn&#8217;t fall asleep last night? The more you reflect on it, the more you worry it will happen again tonight.</p><p>But good sleep isn&#8217;t just in your head. It&#8217;s also in your bed. Enter Eight Sleep, which tackles one of sleep's critical variables: temperature regulation. It's more than just a mattress pad; it's a gateway to tailored sleep environments.&nbsp;</p><p>But is their app as well-designed as their physical product? &#128716;</p><p>Let&#8217;s start with the positives. Eight Sleep nails the basics. You can adjust your bed's temperature for any season or climate. But then comes its data visualization, where it falls into the same trap as so many apps: it provides detailed analyses of sleep patterns but <strong>lacks actionable advice</strong>.</p><p>Telling me I got 90 minutes of deep sleep is informative, but what next? This data needs to be leveraged to offer tailored suggestions, like winding down routines, ideal room temperatures, or dietary recommendations that could enhance sleep quality.</p><h2>&#8216;Past behavior&#8217; vs. behavior change</h2><p>How can designers and product managers do better? We can start by rethinking why we visualize data in the first place. The goal should be to not only inform, but also drive user action:</p><p><strong>Focus on the key behavior:</strong>&nbsp; What do you want people to do? At Irrational Labs, we use the <a href="https://irrationallabs.com/blog/the-3b-framework-the-irrational-labs-approach-to-behavior-change/">3B Framework</a> (identify one key <strong>b</strong>ehavior you want to drive, reduce <strong>b</strong>arriers to achieving it, and amplify the <strong>b</strong>enefits to motivate people to do it). Your data visualizations should drive that key behavior. It&#8217;s that simple.</p><p><strong>Balance information with simplicity</strong>: Provide enough data to be informative, but do it within a simple, user-friendly interface. This way, key insights will stand out and facilitate action (behavior change!) without overwhelming.</p><h2>From metrics to meaningful change</h2><p>In conclusion, while I&#8217;m a fan of Eight Sleep for nailing the temp/sleep connection, the app misses an opportunity. The future of sleep tech isn&#8217;t just about tracking sleep, but <strong>actively participating in improving it</strong>. All products need to learn this lesson, from telehealth and nutrition apps to dating or exercise&#8212;and not hit &#8220;snooze&#8221; on helping users shape their future. &#128564;</p><p>Sleep well, and dream of better product design. &#10024;</p><div class="native-video-embed" data-component-name="VideoPlaceholder" data-attrs="{&quot;mediaUploadId&quot;:&quot;ddc2ad35-f4ec-4199-aae1-62ba38955bdc&quot;,&quot;duration&quot;:null}"></div><p><em><strong>Have a friend who would enjoy these teardowns?
