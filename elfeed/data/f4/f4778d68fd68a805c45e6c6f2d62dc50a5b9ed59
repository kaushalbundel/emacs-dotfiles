Today I’m excited to announce the launch of the new  <a href="https://forum.systemcrafters.net">System Crafters Forum</a>!
</p>

 <p>
For years now, our community has lacked a good middle ground between the main System Crafters website and the various chat channels we’ve used (Discord, Matrix, IRC) to offer a more reliable environment for asking questions, finding answers, and sharing the cool things we’ve made.
</p>

 <p>
I recently started looking into  <a href="https://www.discourse.org">Discourse</a> as an option and was very impressed with the capabilities that they provide.  I feel confident that our new forum be the ideal home for many of the community activities that I’m planning in the near future like hackathons, mini-conferences, courses, mentoring groups, and more!
</p>

 <p>
With the introduction of the forum, the IRC chat will become more of a lounge for the community where people can hang out and discuss topics of interest in a more ephemeral way.  Any time a question in the chat is more deep than just a one-line answer, it should probably move to the forum so that others can find the answer in the future!
</p>

 <p>
To start things off, I’ve added categories for relevant topics like  <a href="https://forum.systemcrafters.net/c/emacs">Emacs</a>,  <a href="https://forum.systemcrafters.net/c/guix">Guix</a>, and  <a href="https://forum.systemcrafters.net/c/programming">Programming</a>, but there’s probably a lot more we’d like to discuss.  Please  <a href="https://forum.systemcrafters.net/new-topic?&category=General">create a post</a> and suggest other categories we should add!
</p>

 <p>
If you’re interested to participate, head to the  <a href="https://forum.systemcrafters.net/">forum site</a>, browse around, and then sign up for an account.  We look forward to seeing you there!
