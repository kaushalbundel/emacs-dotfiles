  <p>I always feel life is boring, especially when I’m alone and have nothing to
do (e.g., the hours before I go to sleep, the weekend). I’ve tried many
ways to deal with boredom, reading books, painting, watching movies, e.t.c.
However, I found these activities only make me get something to do, I still
feel bored when I have nothing to do （ironically, I feel bored again when I
go to my bed to sleep after painting).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Have you tried any outdoor activities? They do not have to be
particularly fancy. For example, I dealt with boredom by making a habit
out of walking. To get into the flow, I needed something that would
interest me, so I bought a generic point-and-click camera. It was not
special, but it motivated me to go around and take pictures. Over time,
I wanted to shoot better scenes/themes, so I started exploring parks and
monuments, until I began venturing outside the city to catch some
sunrise or sunset. I was hooked! I have been walking daily ever since.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I hear that many mathematicians think about math problems when they have
nothing to do. I think thinking might be a good way for my case, since
thinking has no dependency compared to other activities, I can think
anywhere at any time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are right that thinking can be done anywhere. Whether this is good
or not will depend on your particularities. For me, thinking too much is
not good because I over-analyse things and ultimately lose sense of what
needs to happen. Thinking, especially in abstract terms, does not
involve considerations of the place and the timing of events, but our
everyday experience is all about these aspects of acting in the
here-and-now.</p>

<p>Put differently, I learnt that for me a physical, outdoors activity is
the best way to (i) not get into overthinking mode, and (ii) not feel
bored.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>However, I find it’s very hard for me to think, I can’t find a subject to
think about, not to mention using thinking to deal with boredom. Do you
have any suggestions to develop the ability of thinking?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The fact that you cannot find something to think about may be an
indication that you are not getting outside your comfort zone. Sure, you
do not want to venture too far away, but it is good for you to try
something new. I do not know you, so I cannot imagine what “something
new” entails, so I will give an example based on my experience.</p>

<p>Circa mid-2010s I was feeling bored a lot. I decided to check out this
whole “Linux thing”. At the time, I only had basic knowledge of
computer usage: I had learnt about, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Ctrl+c</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Ctrl+v</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Alt+Tab</code>
a couple years prior. I had no formal training in computer science or
related and I did not know what I was trying to achieve with Linux.
All I knew was that software freedom made sense to me and that I would
be learning lots of new things along the way.</p>

<p>I figured out how to install Linux Mint and off I went into the unknown.
Each day I would tinker with the computer. Change the fonts, find some
new icon theme, experiment with multiple desktops/workspaces, set up a
tiling window manager, switch to Arch Linux, and so on. Part of this
incessant experimentation was my transition to terminal-based
applications. I remember using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cmus</code> program at some point to play
back my local music files. It was fun! Was I more efficient? Not
necessarily; not at the outset, anyway. But I was keeping myself in a
virtuous cycle of excitement and discovery.</p>

<p>Fast forward to present time and I still tinker with the computer, only
now I do it from a position of knowledge and am more deliberate. I have
learnt a lot about computers and can even program competently in Emacs
Lisp (sure, that is not a marketable skill per se, but remember I was/am
just playing around).</p>

<p>Perhaps the language I am using to describe this activity—“playing
around”—is read in a negative way. Though I only mean it positively.
To me this has both recreational and educational value. I need
activities I do at my leisure to be enriching my life and to not feel
burdensome. They are fun and play is essential in our lives
(interestingly, the Greek word for recreational, fun activities is
“psychagogia” (ψυχαγωγία) from psyche (soul/mind) and agoge
(education/instruction)).</p>

<p>In more recent times, I have had another “getting out of my comfort
zone” moment, as I built the hut where I now live. Again, this is me
doing stuff while learning as I go. What I learnt about myself through
Linux and Emacs—namely, that I can be competent in a new field with
enough effort—inspires me to boldly take on new challenges, such as
the building of my house, the planting of trees, and so on.</p>

<p>Between the computer and all the outdoor activities I perform (walking,
construction, and the first stages of farming my own stuff), I never
find myself in a state of meaninglessness or boredom. There is always
something I enjoy and consider interesting. Plus, the outdoor activities
expose me to sunshine, which is good for the body.</p>

<p>As for the “how to think” part, I find that the aforementioned have
helped me think with clarity. This is because I do not have thoughts
that trouble me, nor am I overthinking to the point of generating
persistent ideas that effectively crowd out other thoughts. Put simply,
my mind is clean and there is no junk around to inhibit me.</p>

<p>Again, you have to consider the particularities of your case. I do not
mean to imply that what works for me will necessarily work for you. Do
try to push against the boundaries of your comfort zone. You will be
surprised how much you can achieve once you commit to unfamiliar
endeavours in earnest.</p>
