<p>This was an eventful year. My son went to preschool,
I joined Carta, left Calm, and wrote my third book.
It was also a logistically intensive year, with our toddler heading to preschool,
more work travel, and a bunch of other little bits and pieces.
Here is my year in review summary.</p>
<p><em>I love to read other folks year-in writeups &ndash; if you write one, please send it my way!</em></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Previously: <a href="https://lethain.com/2022-in-review/">2022</a>, <a href="https://lethain.com/2021-in-review/">2021</a>, <a href="https://lethain.com/2020-in-review/">2020</a>, <a href="https://lethain.com/2019-in-review">2019</a>, <a href="https://lethain.com/2018-in-review/">2018</a>, <a href="https://lethain.com/things-learned-in-2017/">2017</a></em></p>
<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
<p>Evaluating my goals for the year:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>[Completed]</strong>
<em>Write at least four good blog posts each year.</em></p>
<p>I wrote a lot this year, including adding five to my <a href="https://lethain.com/featured/">popular posts page</a>, including:
<a href="https://lethain.com/eng-strategies/">Writing an engineering strategy</a>,
<a href="https://lethain.com/measuring-engineering-organizations/">Measuring an engineering organization</a>,
<a href="https://lethain.com/setting-engineering-org-values/">Setting organizational values</a>,
and
<a href="https://lethain.com/writers-who-operate/">Writers who operate</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>[Completed]</strong>
<em>Write another book about engineering or leadership.</em></p>
<p>I did this: <em><a href="https://lethain.com/eng-execs-primer/">The Engineering Executive&rsquo;s Primer</a></em>
goes to print in late January, and should be available for purchase in February.
The complete digital version will be available via O&rsquo;Reilly in January.</p>
<p>I am currently brainstorming a bit on a fourth book, very likely my last
on the topic of engineering leadership, although it&rsquo;ll take a bit of time
to decide whether and when to take that on. Right now mostly thining about the topic
of engineering strategy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>[Mixed]</strong>
<em>Do something substantial and new every year that provides new perspective or deeper practice.</em></p>
<p>Like clockwork, I struggle to give myself a passing grade on this one.
Joining Carta has greatly expanded my perspective on executive leadership.
I also worked with a new publisher, O&rsquo;Reilly, which provided a different
view into the book creation process than self-publishing or working with Stripe Press.
This was also the first year I gave a keynote, this one at QCon, which maybe qualifies?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>[In progress]</strong>
<em>20+ folks who Iâ€™ve managed or meaningfully supported move into VPE or CTO roles at 50+ person or $100M+ valuation companies.</em></p>
<p>This goal is due in 2029. Without spending much time thinking this through, there are at least five folks
who qualify here, and I bet I could get to at least ten if I spent long enough digging into it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>[Completed]</strong>
<em>Work towards a clear goal for physical exercise. (Hitting the goal isn&rsquo;t important.)</em></p>
<p>Discussed a bit more below, but I reset my running habbit and worked back up to
doing a few eight mile runs. I&rsquo;m mostly doing four milers now that I&rsquo;m working full-time
again, but it was very validating to stretch milleage a bit!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="carta--calm">Carta &amp; Calm</h2>
<p>I <a href="https://lethain.com/leaving-calm/">left Calm</a> earlier this year.
I planned to take a year off, but ended up joining Carta after a couple months.
When I explain this to folks, particularly those who I&rsquo;d already told that I wasn&rsquo;t
going to go back to work immediately, what I tell them is:
I felt confident that I would regret declining the offer to join Carta.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s still how I feel ~nine months into the job.
Personally, learning and impact are the two things I value most in my work,
and Carta remains the highest indexing job I&rsquo;ve ever had on both counts.</p>
<h2 id="an-engineering-executives-primer"><em>An Engineering Executive&rsquo;s Primer</em></h2>
<p>I started and finished <em><a href="https://lethain.com/eng-execs-primer/">An Engineering Executive&rsquo;s Primer</a></em> this year.
Coming into the year, I expected to write another book this decade, but it wasn&rsquo;t
this book, instead it was <em><a href="https://infraeng.dev/">Infrastructure Engineering</a></em>, which I ended
up not making much progress on. I <a href="https://lethain.com/publishing-eng-execs-primer/">wrote up notes on writing <em>Primer</em></a>, and altogether
I&rsquo;m proud of the book and how quickly it came together.</p>
<h2 id="other-books">Other books</h2>
<p>It feels good to finish #3, and I think I could put down the pen at this point and not
feel like a fraud to consider myself a writer, but I&rsquo;m not done quite yet.
I still have at least one more topic I want to spend some words on, engineering strategy.
(I have no idea if I&rsquo;ll ever get back to the <em>Infrastructure Engineering</em> book,
I&rsquo;m finding it hard to marshall the focus onto a topic that I&rsquo;m not working on directly
day to day.)</p>
<p>My first two books, <em>An Elegant Puzzle</em> and <em>Staff Engineer</em> are both doing well.
Have been translated a few more times and so on, but nothing too wild.
As I mentioned last year, I&rsquo;m working hard to focus on the new things I do,
and not to spend much time thinking about stuff I&rsquo;ve already done,
hence not reporting on book sales and such anymore.</p>
<h2 id="first-keynote">First keynote</h2>
<p>I gave my first first keynote, <a href="https://lethain.com/solving-the-engineering-strategy-crisis/">Solving the Engineering Strategy crisis</a> at QCon SF.
You can see <a href="https://lethain.com/solving-the-engineering-strategy-crisis-videos/">a video recording of that talk on Youtube</a>.
I&rsquo;m mostly avoiding conference talks these days, but it was impossible to pass up the opportunity to give my
first keynote, particularly a keynote that didn&rsquo;t require traveling for the conference.</p>
<p>There aren&rsquo;t any conference talks on my schedule for 2024
but if I do some it&rsquo;ll probably be focused on the topic of engineering strategy.</p>
<h2 id="advent-of-code">Advent of Code</h2>
<p>I made it through day twelve of <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a> this year
before deciding I needed to bail out.
Some years ago I read Tanya Reilly&rsquo;s <a href="https://noidea.dog/blog/i-love-advent-of-code">ode to Advent of Code</a>,
and attempted it that year before getting busy, and decided to try again this year as quite a few work, professional
and friend groups participated. I really enjoy working on these, but they&rsquo;re competing for writing project
time, and that&rsquo;s just hard to fit in with the work travel, family visits, and so on that happen around the
holidays. Maybe next year.</p>
<h2 id="angel-investments">Angel investments</h2>
<p>I did four angel investments this year, and invested in one fund as a limited partner.
This is, give or take, roughly the sort of angel investing year I expect to have most
years going forward, but it&rsquo;s not a goal or a priority. I just evaluate the interesting
things that come my way and occasionally invest.
(I am mostly interested in developer experience, productivity, and infrastruture startups,
as it&rsquo;s the space I understand best and where I think my input is most useful.)</p>
<h2 id="reading">Reading</h2>
<p>After finishing up <em>Primer</em>, I&rsquo;ve been doing a bunch of professional reading.
Much of this has been related to <a href="https://lethain.com/strategy-notes/">collecting my thoughts on engineering strategy</a>,
but some of it has been mining for ideas (including structural and presentation ideas)
both as a leader and as an author who writes books.</p>
<p>The professional book I&rsquo;ve read in the last few months are:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><a href="https://lethain.com/notes-on-enterprise-architecture-as-strategy/">Enterprise Architecture as Strategy</a></em></li>

<h2 id="year-of-personal-admin">Year of personal admin</h2>
<p>In addition to various work stuff, this was also a year of personal admin for me,
where I tried to catch up on a few years of neglected tasks and ambitions around the house
and my body.</p>
<h3 id="wearing-glasses">Wearing glasses</h3>
<p>I wore glasses until I was 13 or so, then I stopped wearing them, essentially on a whim.
My vision was good enough for most purposes, including getting a drivers license, so I just
didn&rsquo;t think about it much for the following 20-plus years.
Not thinking about it was nice.</p>
<p>When I started my new job, I started getting frequent migraines.
Trying to diagnose what might be going wrong, it was clear that I was spending more
time looking directly at a computer monitor that I had for several years,
and I tried wearing a pair of old glasses that I had made about fifteen years ago
as a last resort if I needed them to pass the vision portion of the California driving exam.</p>
<p>It turned out, this worked very well, and my eyes and head have felt much better since returning
to wearing glasses. I don&rsquo;t wear them all the time, but I do wear them whenever I sit down to do more than a few
minutes of work on the computer.
Age is, I suppose, more than just a number.</p>
<h3 id="running">Running</h3>
<p>Since graduating college, I&rsquo;ve always been a frequent runner, although rarely been a serious runner.
More concretely, other than a detour for a stress fracture, I&rsquo;ve gone on 2-3 runs a week, averaging 3-4 miles, for quite a long time.
In roughly 2013, I ramped up my runs for a while, building up to 6-8 mile runs twice a week for a few months, before
ramping back down to my shorter runs.
The shorter runs are nice because they take less time, and they also put a bit less strain on my knees which have at times been a
bit unreliable. Plus, I generally prefer to stress my knees playing basketball instead of running.</p>
<p>This year, I wanted to build up my running distance and pace, with the goal of reestablishing a higher fitness baseline.
Starting from my 3-4 mile runs, I rebuilt up to 8
mile runs, with my fastest average pace at 8 miles being 8 minutes and 42 seconds.
I intended to spend more time working on my pace doing short runs,
but I got distracted by the new job.</p>
<p>Relatedly, I&rsquo;ve long been on the fence about buying an Apple Watch, but decided to buy one to help
track my runs, and it&rsquo;s been a surprisingly delightful piece of hardware.
(I specifically bought the <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra</a>.)
If I hadn&rsquo;t bought it, I would absolutely not know how much I&rsquo;d run, or the pace I ran at.
It&rsquo;s safe to say that I wouldn&rsquo;t have even tried to do a pace goal, which would have considerably
reduced the impact of my running workouts (e.g. only doing slow, long runs, rather than a mix of slow/long
and fast/short) and results.</p>
<p>These are, on an absolute scale, not particularly big achievements.
I know many runners who are much faster, go much longer, and are even much faster while going much longer,
but it still felt good for me!
I have no ambitions to be a competitive racer, I just like to push myself a bit occasionally,
and particularly to continue pushing myself as I get older to remember that physical decline is in many ways
a sum of choices rather than an inevitability.</p>
<h3 id="invisalign">Invisalign</h3>
<p>In January, I started on <a href="https://www.invisalign.com/">Invisalign</a> to improve parts of my bite,
along with crowding in my lower front teeth.
The plan was that I&rsquo;d only wear them for four months, but twelve months later I&rsquo;m still wearing them
as the original set of trays didn&rsquo;t fully work out. I&rsquo;m scheduled to finish in February now, and am looking forward
to no longer timing coffee consumption quite so carefully.</p>

<p>Thatâ€™s my annual year in review for 2023!
If youâ€™re writing one, please send it my way! Love to hear what folks are working on and thinking about over the course of years.</p>
