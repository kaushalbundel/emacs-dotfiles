<p>The dream of soaring in the sky like a bird has captivated the human mind for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icarus">ages</a>. Although many failed, some eventually <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wright_Flyer">succeeded</a> in achieving that goal. These days we take air transportation for granted, but the physics of flight can still be puzzling.</p>
<p>In this article we&rsquo;ll investigate what makes airplanes fly by looking at the forces generated by the flow of air around the aircraft&rsquo;s wings. More specifically, we&rsquo;ll focus on the cross section of those wings to reveal the shape of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airfoil"><em>airfoil</em></a> â€“ you can see it presented in <span class="cross_section"><strong>yellow</strong></span> below:</p><br><br>This article has many interactive demonstrations which are best seen <a href="https://ciechanow.ski/airfoil/">on the website</a>.
