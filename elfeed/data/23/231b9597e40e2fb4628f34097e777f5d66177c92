<p>Munger giving the USC Law Commencement 2007 (via <a href="https://x.com/garrytan/status/1729678525257433499">@garrytan</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The last idea that I want to give you, as you go out into a profession that frequently puts a lot of procedure, and a lot of precautions, and a lot of mumbo-jumbo into what it does, this is not the highest form which civilization can reach.</p>

  <p><strong>The highest form that civilization can reach is a seamless web of deserved trust.</strong> Not much procedure, just totally reliable people correctly trusting one another.</p>

  <p>That’s the way an operating room works at the Mayo Clinic. If a bunch of lawyers were to introduce a lot of process, the patients would all die.</p>

  <p>So never forget, when you’re a lawyer, that you may be rewarded for selling this stuff, but you don’t have to buy it. In your own life, what you want is a seamless web of deserved trust. And if your proposed marriage contract has forty-seven pages, my suggestion is you not enter.</p>

He proposes “d/acc”, where the “d” can stand for “many things; particularly, defense, decentralization, democracy and differential,” and he suggests this message to AI developers: “you should build, and build profitable things, but be much more selective and intentional in making sure you are building things that help you and humanity thrive”</li>
  <li><a href="https://michaelnotebook.com/ti/index.html">Michael Nielsen on “wise accelerationism”</a>. “Will a sufficiently deep understanding of nature make it almost trivial for an individual to make catastrophic, ungovernable technologies?” If so, “what institutional ideas or governance mechanisms can we use to stay out of this dangerous realm?”</li>

These issues are too crucial to be left to vibes-based shitposters” (<a href="https://x.com/jasoncrawford/status/1727149155691213004">me</a>).

  <li>“I’m neither an accelerationist nor a decel when it comes to AI / AGI. This is technology we absolutely must build, and we’ll build it regardless. But I hope thoughtfully, not carelessly.

I particularly appreciated <a href="https://x.com/jachiam0/status/1727863887389712674">this point</a>: “When people ask me what safety is, my answer is always something along the lines of: ‘safety is a negotiation between stakeholders about acceptable risk.’ All parts of this are important. Safety is not a state; it’s a conversation, a negotiation”</li>
  <li>“I take AI safety pretty seriously, but it really bothers me that some in the AI safety world don’t take the upsides of AGI seriously. Yes, we should try to avoid an AGI that wipes out humanity, but an AGI that could <em>end death</em> isn’t something to give up trying to develop ASAP” (<a href="https://x.com/s8mb/status/1726541738293309686">@s8mb</a>)</li>
  <li>“There will almost certainly come a point (p=.999?) where an AI is developed that a) poses no threat to humanity civilization and b) is able to perform enough economically meaningful work to cause some humans to lose their jobs. At that point, there will be bootleggers and Baptists situation. Make-workers = bootleggers; Safetyists = Baptists. We have few social antibodies against this kind of alliance. I continue to worry we will never reap the economic benefits of AI. We need: decentralized and open source AI; freedom to compute; preemptive attacks on make-workism; a norm against restrictive forms of safetyism unless there is some kind of empirical evidence that danger is imminent” (<a href="https://x.com/elidourado/status/1727704861762838943">@elidourado</a>)</li>

  <p>… from the beginning America’s religion has been the religion of work. In other societies, heredity, class, social status, ethnicity, and family are the principal sources of status and legitimacy. In America, work is. In different ways both aristocratic and socialist societies tend to demean and discourage work. Bourgeois societies promote work. America, the quintessential bourgeois society, glorifies work. When asked “What do you do?” almost no American dares answer “Nothing.”</p>

<p>On nuclear construction cost increases, from <a href="https://www.osti.gov/etdeweb/biblio/6776328">Crowley and Griffith 1982, “US construction cost rise threatens nuclear option”</a> (via <a href="https://x.com/whatisnuclear/status/1726851866255102076">@whatisnuclear</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The increases are not caused directly by the regulations. Rather, they result from interaction of NRC and industry staffs in an effort to obtain the goals of “zero risk and “zero defects” in an adversarial and legalistic regulatory environment. The pursuit of “zero risk” means that all failure modes have the same importance regardless of their probability of occurrence. The pursuit of “zero defects” encourages continuous expansion of the number of alternatives that must be analyzed and continuous refinements of the requirements. The legal need for “evidence” encourages development of complex analyses rather than simple ones. It also submerges the fact that all engineering analyses are really approximations to actual phenomena because such subjective pos-itions are difficult to defend in court.</p>

  <p>The advantage which “precedent” has in the legal environment encourages the adoption of unrealistic and expensive approaches because it is easier than suffering the uncertainty associated with trying to have a new approach accepted. The continuation of this situation for a decade has resulted in the tradition that if a method is more complex, more difficult and more time consuming, it must be safer! The development over the last decade of seismic design criteria and design approaches with respect to piping systems is an example of the situation.</p>

  <p>The classic division of authority and responsibilities between engineer, manufacturer and constructor has been distorted by the fear of losing a decision in a regulatory or judicial hearing which would cause political damage to the regulatory agency or financial damage to the utility. Consequently, there has been an ever increasing reliance on academic analytical techniques rather than experienced judgment. The concept of “good engineering practice” is discouraged during construction. Analysts and designers on both regulatory and industrial staffs inexperienced in the realities of hardware and construction practices are making impractical design decisions which have been exceedingly damaging to nuclear industry economics.</p>

  <p>Ironically, some of the decisions that have been made in the name of improving safety margins for low probability events, may have reduced the safety margins for high probability events. The UE&amp;C piping study uncovered numerous areas where the tolerances requested in the piping design documents might be appropriate for a machine shop oriented manufacturing operation, but are totally unrealistic for field construction.</p>
