<p>In this ~7 minute video I show the progress I made with a critical
flood control project. I built a small wall made out of stones I have
been unearthing from my land. I am consolidating the group by planting
some grapevines that I got as a gift recently. I do not know who left
the small grapevines on my land, so I am calling them “Santa’s
grapevines”.</p>
