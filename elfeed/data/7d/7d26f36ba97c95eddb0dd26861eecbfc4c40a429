<p>My new video course entitled &#8220;The practice of self-acceptance, or, stop punching yourself in the head psychologically&#8221; is out today. It is $75.&nbsp;</p><p>If you&#8217;d like to just buy the thing, click <a href="https://sashachapin.thrivecart.com/the-practice-of-okayness/">here</a>. If you&#8217;d like to go to the landing page to get more info and sample videos, click <a href="https://www.sashachapin.com/self-acceptance-course">here</a>.</p><p>Ever since I wrote <a href="https://sashachapin.substack.com/p/how-i-attained-persistent-self-love">this massive post</a> about accepting myself, I&#8217;ve been fielding a lot of questions along the lines of, &#8220;hey, I like the sound of this self-acceptance stuff, but I don&#8217;t know how to do that, how do I do it?&#8221; I&#8217;ve responded with a spray of book recommendations, tweets, and disconnected YouTube videos, which is fine enough. But there hasn&#8217;t been one resource I&#8217;ve been happy to point people towards, and people tend to like having one resource. This is my attempt to create a compact, helpful resource.</p><p>It contains guides to nine practices that have been helpful for me, as well as some material about the mindsets and attitudes that made self-acceptance stick. This, I think, is more important than any specific technique. In the end, everyone&#8217;s suffering is a unique little personal wasp&#8217;s nest&#8212;everyone needs to figure out what works for them, and this will likely be a blend of approaches, rather than any one mantra or whatever.</p><p>If you&#8217;re interested in developing more self-acceptance, I think the course could be helpful for you! I also think it could make a solid (if unconventional) holiday gift.</p><p>As with my previous course, it will probably get updated over time with bonus units. To facilitate this, I encourage anyone taking the course to pelt me with questions.&nbsp;</p><p>Making the course was fun, but also strenuous&#8212;I filmed the thing twice because I realized I didn&#8217;t get the tone right the first time, took out some units, added some others, and so on. So I&#8217;m taking a break from big projects for a couple of weeks. After that, it&#8217;s likely I&#8217;ll be writing a book in the new year.</p>
