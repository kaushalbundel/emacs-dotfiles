<p>What follows is taken from my journal.</p>

<hr />

<p>The nights are not as humid these days. As we are approaching the full
moon, the days get drier. This is what full moons do during the autumn
and winter seasons: they bring extra warmth and sunny days to us. The
inverse happens in spring and in the summer where the full moon
triggers increased humidity and rainfall. At least these are my
observations where I am. Being close to nature fulfils me and inspires
me to remain patient. I have learnt to accept that phenomena happen
during their cycle. I am calm and content.</p>

<p>There are many cases where the phrase “so close; yet so far” applies.
One is human relationships. It is difficult to communicate intent and
to express feelings. Nuances can be interpreted in a variety of ways
and we get caught in an endless cycle of doubting and second guessing
our understanding of concepts. Even when we are direct, we cannot
convince the other person that there is no ulterior motive behind our
words.</p>

<p>As Alkinoos Ioannidis says in one of his songs, “given words have been
dressed with so many lies, how I can say ‘I love you’ for you to
believe me?” What the artist has been tasked to teach us is the truth
of the human condition, though not because words necessarily are
deceitful, but simply due to the multiple possibilities inherent in
our deeds. The “I love you” can mean just that, although it can also
be a facade for “now give me what I want”.</p>

<p>People who know each other well can make the correct guesses. It is
not because they have some special power to read minds. Rather, they
put their faith in the cosmos that their uncertainty will be
ameliorated through hard work and sacrifices. They are willing to take
their chances. These individuals reach a point of shared compassion by
performing a leap of faith together.</p>

<p>We often expect more than what is feasible. An expression of love in
present time must come with guarantees for longer-term commitment.
Sure, it is easy to follow it up with “forever” and such assurances.
Is that true though? How can you honestly say what will happen in the
future? Ceteris paribus, you will be there. Fine! Though “ceteris
paribus” is not how the world works. Even the best intentions, the
most sincere feelings and intimate touches, can only be true in the
here and now. If you receive a kiss today, you like it for what it is
and not because you are certain that there will be another tomorrow.</p>

<p>“So close; yet so far” describes our relationship with nature. If we
speak our mind, we can be seen as forcing things to happen, i.e. to
not let them occur naturally. If we refrain from expressing our
selves, we risk creating doubts and thus inhibiting potentially
mutually desired outcomes. Our nature makes it impossible to operate
in omniscience. There is an element of doubt in every action.</p>

<p>I was shy when I was a child and would say the opposite of what I
wanted. It helped me stay in my comfort zone and I liked that. Though
I did not enjoy the outcomes. I thus realised that me finding comfort
in such situations was a self-inhibition I had to overcome. I
eventually stopped being shy and have been eager to express myself in
earnest when that matters. There is nothing wrong with shyness. The
problem is one of degree, when this attitude blocks you from enjoying
benign experiences without impediments.</p>

<p>Does my developed directness mean that I am now contradicting or
defying the natural flow of things, where phenomena come about
organically? I think not. In the wise lyrics of Alkinoos, words are
indeed dressed in lies, though we cannot let this fact force us into
submission. To mistake inaction for virtue is to make a deep seated
value judgement about the propriety of things: it is to say “I shall
not question the status quo and must live with the fear of being lied
to because this is the best I can get”.</p>

<p>I find that what relieves us from doubt is the boldness with which we
embrace our feelings. For as long as we are honest with ourselves, it
does not matter how many lies are fastened upon the word “love”, as
for us it still carries the meaning we sense deeply. Courage brings us
closer when it is done right.</p>

<p>Does this mean that we do not care about the natural flow? I think
there is no tension here. We can be courageous in the right moments,
while allowing things to develop over time. We do not want to create
artificial constraints, deadlines, demands, etc., as those are not
strong foundations for good communication. Whatever bonds they
establish, will be severed with ease. Rather, we have to be patient
and recognise when to be assertive and when to remain passive.</p>

<p>We have to apply judgement. The indiscriminate application of rules is
our downfall. Sometimes, we have to wait. At others, we must act.
Given our ignorance, we cannot know in advance which is which. All we
can do is assess the situation to the best of our abilities, be honest
with ourselves, express our feelings with honesty and kindness, and
accept that there is always an element of risk given our ignorance.
If we get the message across, so be it. If we fail, so be it. Nobody
knows for sure how and when it works. This is our nature after all.</p>

<p>It is with these thoughts and without expectations that I welcome
another day.</p>
