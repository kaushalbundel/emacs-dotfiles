<p>I have been doing a lot of work at my place since my wrist healed. In
this short video I show the in-progress storage room I am setting up.
It is made out of wooden pallets and I will eventually add thin
metallic sheets at its exterior to provide basic insulation. I
continue with my projects here, one small step a time, and am aware
that it will take a long time before this is a decent place.</p>
