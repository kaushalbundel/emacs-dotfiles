California, he conceived an idea that would forever be ingrained in the groovy nostalgia of 1970s Americana.</p><p>Per the oft repeated lore, his comrades at the time were embroiled in animated dialogue about the mishaps and misadventures of their various pets. Their respective dogs, cats, birds and hamsters stood accused of being vacuums of attention and agents of chaos. They required round-the-clock maintenance, and demanded total fealty from their owners.</p><p>Dahl - though critter-less at the time - was eager to contribute to the discussion. He boasted that his own beastly buddy required none of the subservience that seemed to ail his compatriots. He said he had a pet that didn&#8217;t need to be fed, cleaned, groomed or entertained. It would not get sick, it would not disobey, it would not die.</p><p>His friends were curious to hear more about this apparently perfect pet. As they leaned closer, expecting to be regaled with tales of some fantastically tame impala, Dahl came clean.</p><p>&#8220;I have a pet rock,&#8221; he <a href="https://www.inventorsdigest.com/articles/timing-marketing-made-pet-rock-roll/">said</a> with a grin, revealing his charade.</p><p>As he proudly soaked in the lukewarm bath of his punchline, he had unwittingly provoked a very serious conversation about the merits and shortfalls of a theoretical pet rock. After a round of lively debate, the party concluded that - for all the exact reasons that Dahl had joked about earlier - a pet rock would indeed be the ideal companion.</p><p>When the tabs were settled for the night, the group dispersed, bleary-eyed, back to their own homes. For Dahl, the evening was just getting started.&nbsp;</p><p>While the others had filed the pet rock debate away the same way you might do with other hall-of-fame bar conversations like &#8220;would you rather have the ability to teleport or fly?&#8221;, Dahl had seen a thread worth tugging on. His curiosity wasn&#8217;t just aroused, it was ready to climax. As an advertising executive (and at the time a freelance copywriter) he had seen opportunity when others had seen silliness.&nbsp;</p><p>After returning home that evening, he began drafting a whimsical instruction manual for would-be owners of his fictional pet rock. In the subsequent weeks, he found a local gravel supplier from whom he bought a stockpile of handsome stones. These smooth, grey, egg-shaped stones had been gathered from Rosarito Beach on the Pacific coast of Mexico. Dahl also designed a portable cardboard box (complete with ventilation holes) and lined it with a nest of straw shavings so that his &#8216;companions&#8217; could travel comfortably.&nbsp;</p><p>Four months later, at a gift show in San Francisco in August 1975, the Pet Rock made its official debut.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa55a97e7-f31d-4315-b8ac-b0117d9b3e5e_1456x1462.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa55a97e7-f31d-4315-b8ac-b0117d9b3e5e_1456x1462.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa55a97e7-f31d-4315-b8ac-b0117d9b3e5e_1456x1462.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa55a97e7-f31d-4315-b8ac-b0117d9b3e5e_1456x1462.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa55a97e7-f31d-4315-b8ac-b0117d9b3e5e_1456x1462.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa55a97e7-f31d-4315-b8ac-b0117d9b3e5e_1456x1462.jpeg" width="628" height="630.5879120879121" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a55a97e7-f31d-4315-b8ac-b0117d9b3e5e_1456x1462.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1462,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:628,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;PHOTO: A Pet Rock is displayed with its own carrying case.  &quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;PHOTO: A Pet Rock is displayed with its own carrying case.  &quot;,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="PHOTO: A Pet Rock is displayed with its own carrying case.

Iconic department stores were clamouring to stock his product. He appeared on <em>The Tonight Show</em>. Twice. Three in every four newspapers in the US covered his story. He even snagged a feature in the dignified pages of <em>Newsweek</em>, where his invention was referred to as &#8220;one of the most ridiculously successful marketing schemes ever&#8221;.</p><p>The real clincher wasn&#8217;t the Pet Rock, however, it was the cheeky 32-page <a href="https://archive.org/details/pet_rock_manual_original/mode/2up">instruction manual</a> that came along with it. The little pamphlet helped to bring his idea to life, like a miracle of marketing alchemy. It also allowed Dahl to flex the full range of his copyrighting talents. Titled <em>The Care and Training of Your Pet Rock</em>, the manual contained a litany of jokes, puns, and commands to properly raise your geological companion. It included training tips to help your Pet Rock learn how to <strong>come</strong> (difficult), <strong>stay</strong> (easy), <strong>roll over</strong> (best done on a hill) and <strong>play dead</strong> (a speciality). The guidebook allowed him to conjure <em>meaning</em> where there wasn&#8217;t any before, a virtue consistent with any well executed marketing campaign.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F792966f3-aa61-4468-909d-acae522d389d_981x451.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F792966f3-aa61-4468-909d-acae522d389d_981x451.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F792966f3-aa61-4468-909d-acae522d389d_981x451.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F792966f3-aa61-4468-909d-acae522d389d_981x451.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F792966f3-aa61-4468-909d-acae522d389d_981x451.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F792966f3-aa61-4468-909d-acae522d389d_981x451.jpeg" width="981" height="451" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/792966f3-aa61-4468-909d-acae522d389d_981x451.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:451,&quot;width&quot;:981,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F792966f3-aa61-4468-909d-acae522d389d_981x451.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F792966f3-aa61-4468-909d-acae522d389d_981x451.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F792966f3-aa61-4468-909d-acae522d389d_981x451.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F792966f3-aa61-4468-909d-acae522d389d_981x451.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Source: <a href="https://archive.org/details/pet_rock_manual_original/mode/2up">The Internet Archive</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>Because he launched the product in the run up to the holiday season, the Pet Rock collided head-first with the hordes of holiday shoppers in the US looking for the perfect novelty gift. The appeal was evident in the rabid demand that followed. </p><p>In October, he was shipping 10,000 Pet Rocks every day. </p><p>By December, this number had run up to 100,000 per day. </p><p>By the time Christmas came around, he had sold two and a half tons of Pet Rocks. </p><p>Given that the Rocks cost him just 5 cents to manufacture and retailed for $3.95, Dahl had stumbled into a deliciously lucrative enterprise. His idea would spawn an entire cottage industry of accessory products for Pet Rocks that included clothes, jewellery, cemeteries, training schools, music singles, and even <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/01/us/gary-dahl-inventor-of-the-pet-rock-dies-at-78.html">college degrees</a> ($3 for a bachelor&#8217;s, $10 for a PhD).</p><p>As the calendar flipped over to 1976, the enterprise eventually lost steam. Predictably, fashion had moved on. Pet Rocks had been discarded into the &#8216;Former Fad&#8217; scrap heap. They joined other viral products like the Hula Hoop and the Slinky that had similarly invaded the American retail zeitgeist for a brief spell in the limelight. But by then its creator had long sailed into the sunset.</p><p>In just a couple of months, Gary Dahl had managed to sell close to 1.5 million Mexican beach stones. His Pet Rocks had made him a millionaire, practically overnight. He set up his own novelty gifting company called Rock Bottom Productions (where the receptionist would answer the phone with &#8220;Hi, you&#8217;ve reached Rock Bottom&#8221;). Eager to prove he wasn&#8217;t a one hit wonder, he would later attempt to replicate his original playbook with other gag gifts like the &#8216;Official Sand Breeding Kit&#8217; (self explanatory) and &#8216;Canned Earthquake&#8217; (a coffee can with a wind-up mechanism that caused it to jump around on a table).

No, your job is to find the people that are already looking for the thing you&#8217;re offering, and let them know that you can offer something better than what&#8217;s out there. You need &#8220;the smallest viable audience, not the biggest possible audience."
