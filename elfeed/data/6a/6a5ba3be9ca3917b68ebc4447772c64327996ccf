And Richard Fuisz says the RIMS1 gene (mentioned in the links post; postulated to cause blindness + increased IQ) <a href="https://twitter.com/richardfuisz/status/1763366885188391082?s=46">doesn&#8217;t actually make you blind</a>; nobody has checked the IQ claim yet, but <a href="https://twitter.com/richardfuisz/status/1763591765620121990">here&#8217;s how Richard thinks about it</a>. And a correction: the article about phages was from <a href="https://www.asimov.press/">Asimov Press</a>, not <a href="https://worksinprogress.co/">Works In Progress</a>.</p><p><strong>2: </strong>Last year Manifold Markets held a prediction market conference/festival, Manifest, in Berkeley. I thought it was a lot of fun. They&#8217;re going to do it again this year, June 7 to 9th, you can get tickets <a href="https://www.manifest.is/#tickets">here</a>, cheaper early bird tickets ($249) are first come, first serve.</p><p><strong>3: </strong>I won&#8217;t have a voting guide up in time for the California primary on Tuesday, but Jessica Ocean of the PsychCrisis blog <a href="https://psychcrisis.substack.com/p/the-problem-with-prop-1">has interesting thoughts on Proposition 1</a> (mental health funding).</p>
