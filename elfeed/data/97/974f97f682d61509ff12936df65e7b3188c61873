<p><strong>TLDR: WATCH THE VIDEO (click above)</strong></p><p>UX designers are more than just designers. They&#8217;re choice architects. And how they choose to present us with things profoundly influences our choices.</p><p>Take <strong>job search</strong>, for example.</p><p>Recently I checked out <a href="https://otta.com/">Otta</a>. Otta shows you jobs one at a time; this is called sequential ordering. You look, you evaluate, you click &#8211;&nbsp;or skip to the next option. The alternative UX design would be to show me multiple jobs at once.&nbsp; This is called simultaneous ordering. While this seems like a small UX decision, it will lead people to make very different choices and apply at different rates.</p><p>Why? Imagine you&#8217;re in a police lineup. You&#8217;re not guilty (of course). But someone is evaluating you and they could (wrongly) pick you from the line up.&nbsp;</p><p>Do you want to be standing next to five other potential suspects (simultaneously)? Or would you prefer for the victim to evaluate everyone one at a time (sequentially)? The victim looks at you and decides, then looks at someone else and decides.&nbsp;</p><p>Most likely, you want the sequential option. Research has found that <strong>witnesses are better at identifying suspects</strong> <a href="https://d1wqtxts1xzle7.cloudfront.net/45722153/a_3A101288871500720160517-5983-7qak6c-libre.pdf?1463518164=&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B+filename%3DEyewitness_Accuracy_Rates_in_Sequential.pdf&amp;Expires=1711040902&amp;Signature=MiJdkjeDAkoPf7TVG7o0iMVS~YHGQcr2AIvFqYCihe-1hez7MambJtxYTe3MDKsaexZrDcznhT0tKGtyZdZBclxo8oEUYkO8cjZuE3Dq8Ed-tKZGbouB5DEmdYlEioz9ocRHNV9bMJuFtRjkgcGqFzy2lf01tUqT9ScIrFkcFl-nV6jQXlBfsVrBIwsiCLzFnqvC9qrGL5fqU-E5VyFs7i-UwM46BYbe~lUCN-~2mMLi2Lj9-6Rn63ltVzG2nEPTeR3uesoDxIS8bPNGo7glKHoLqNsFBT~TRQpdYJbErLCcAqCn9c4a217BqLxiWm9izXLZ1w80w6CmOhgzrFhhmQ__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAJLOHF5GGSLRBV4ZA">in sequential lineups vs. simultaneous ones</a>. When options are presented to us one by one, we evaluate them on their own merits, using our internal benchmarks.&nbsp;This leads to decisions that are more about optimal fit and less about relative advantage. Whereas in simultaneous lineups, the victim is thinking: which of these people looks <em>most like </em>the perpetrator?</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb4e93ee-ee04-4800-ba15-7b9eba6e40c8_741x435.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb4e93ee-ee04-4800-ba15-7b9eba6e40c8_741x435.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb4e93ee-ee04-4800-ba15-7b9eba6e40c8_741x435.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb4e93ee-ee04-4800-ba15-7b9eba6e40c8_741x435.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb4e93ee-ee04-4800-ba15-7b9eba6e40c8_741x435.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb4e93ee-ee04-4800-ba15-7b9eba6e40c8_741x435.png" width="741" height="435" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/db4e93ee-ee04-4800-ba15-7b9eba6e40c8_741x435.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:435,&quot;width&quot;:741,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:439832,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb4e93ee-ee04-4800-ba15-7b9eba6e40c8_741x435.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb4e93ee-ee04-4800-ba15-7b9eba6e40c8_741x435.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb4e93ee-ee04-4800-ba15-7b9eba6e40c8_741x435.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb4e93ee-ee04-4800-ba15-7b9eba6e40c8_741x435.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><h2>Which UX pattern should you use when?</h2><p>Otta's choice to present jobs sequentially could be good for job seekers in some ways, but it also may backfire. A sequential decision forces users to consider each job on its own terms. This likely leads to more thoughtful job applications and, ultimately, more satisfying career moves &#8211; you&#8217;re comparing the potential job to your dream job.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>However, it also values <strong>quality over quantity</strong>. You may swipe through five jobs and decide none of the jobs stacks up to your ideal dream job.&nbsp;</p><p>If you instead had five jobs shown to you at once, you&#8217;d likely change your mental frame and evaluate which was most likely to meet your criteria. When applying to jobs, this is probably a good thing; it takes a lot of applications to land a job. As with dating, the name of the game is to get out there. Start applying. Talk to employers. If you wait to apply for your dream job, then don&#8217;t get it, you may be left still swiping. So if you&#8217;re Otta and the goal is to get someone to land a job, you need people to start applying to them! And that means you may want to <strong>reverse the strategy</strong> and go with a simultaneous lineup of jobs vs. sequential.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Otta's UX is a reminder of how powerfully <strong>design influences our choices</strong>. Whether we&#8217;re choosing a job, deciding what to order from UberEats, or picking a suspect out of a police lineup, how options are presented matters. A lot.</p><p><strong>3 takeaways from the teardown:</strong></p><p>&#128188; When to use <strong>sequential</strong> vs. <strong>simultaneous</strong> ordering</p><p>&#128188; The design of <strong>choice environments</strong>, even in digital spaces, significantly impacts our preferences and actions.</p><p>&#128188; UX isn't just about ease of use; it's a tool for <strong>behavior change.</strong></p><p><strong>Your insights:</strong> Have you experienced decision fatigue in an app or product?
