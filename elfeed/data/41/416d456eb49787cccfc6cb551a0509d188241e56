If there was a Hall of Fame for quotes, Michelangelo would probably own considerable real estate in some bedazzled corridor off of those two smash hits alone. </p><p>You can immediately understand why creators (and curators) of all shapes and sizes would gravitate to the wisdom contained in those words. To Michelangelo, perhaps counter-intuitively, the job of the artist was to unveil rather than construct. It was about stripping away everything that didn&#8217;t fit his vision, leaving behind only the material that did.</p><p>I think about brand building the same way. </p><p>When we started Tigerfeathers in mid-2020, we were essentially confronting a big block of marble that could have been carved in an infinite number of different ways. At the time we weren&#8217;t looking at meticulously piecing together a specific brand identity. We just wanted a permanent address where we could house our writing on the Internet. We had the tools, but no real plan of attack.</p><p>Back then our main objective was to validate our theses on whether:<br>- content creation was an effective mechanism for nurturing professional leverage<br>- companies in the digital age could be built &#8216;audience-first&#8217; instead of &#8216;product-first&#8217;<br>- an independent newsletter could be scaled into a sustainable business<br>- amateur writers could find success on Substack</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa951c96d-7ffe-41f3-b45c-decde4779541_998x545.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa951c96d-7ffe-41f3-b45c-decde4779541_998x545.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa951c96d-7ffe-41f3-b45c-decde4779541_998x545.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa951c96d-7ffe-41f3-b45c-decde4779541_998x545.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa951c96d-7ffe-41f3-b45c-decde4779541_998x545.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa951c96d-7ffe-41f3-b45c-decde4779541_998x545.png" width="998" height="545" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a951c96d-7ffe-41f3-b45c-decde4779541_998x545.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:545,&quot;width&quot;:998,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:105526,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa951c96d-7ffe-41f3-b45c-decde4779541_998x545.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa951c96d-7ffe-41f3-b45c-decde4779541_998x545.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa951c96d-7ffe-41f3-b45c-decde4779541_998x545.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa951c96d-7ffe-41f3-b45c-decde4779541_998x545.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">This is an actual slide from a presentation I made to Aaryaman in May 2020 to convince him it was worth starting a newsletter together.

From our experience so far, we know that:<br>- there&#8217;s a keen interest in the Indian tech ecosystem from investors, founders, and operators around the world<br>- our audience is less excited about hearing our views on global tech developments, and more attentive when we highlight trends, companies, and stories from India<br>- even in the age of short-form-everything, there&#8217;s still an appetite for long-form essays that are well written, deeply researched, and entertaining to read<br>- a single well-forged piece of content can be a potent resource in the Internet age; like a digital missionary that can be called upon to solve a number of different problems; like a precious resource that can be mined again and again and again</p><p>These insights might morph as our sample size grows, but for now we have an idea of who our audience is and what they want from us. We have a better picture of what the Tigerfeathers brand is, and more importantly, what it <em>isn&#8217;t</em>.</p><p>And so the marble starts to look less like a block and more like a sculpture. </p><p>In 2023, the &#8216;market&#8217; for newsletters is different from what it was in mid-2020. For one, people aren&#8217;t stuck at home with endless time to read. And two, we&#8217;ve officially entered the age of AI-assisted content, which means the Internet is about to be flooded with an endless sea of commoditised media that&#8217;s been vomited out by applications like ChatGPT, DALL-E 2, Midjourney, and others. </p><p>The bar for good content is significantly higher. For us to &#8216;make it&#8217;, the Tigerfeathers brand needs to stand out on the Internet, and also amidst the landscape of Indian tech publications. I think we can.</p><p>Going forward, it makes sense to double down on what makes us unique, like:<br>- creating content that you can definitively tell was written by humans, for humans<br>- stories about India, and particularly about the people, products and ideas that will define the future of Indian tech<br>- writing that is equal parts entertaining and informative (i.e. we want to make our readers laugh)<br>- writing that is infused with genuine passion and curiosity for the subject matter (like crypto, Indian entrepreneurship, the creator economy, and AI)</p><p>For now, the goal is to become the gold standard for writing and storytelling in the Indian startup ecosystem. Hopefully that opens the door to other cool ways to extend the brand.</p><p>I can&#8217;t say for sure what the final destination of this newsletter will be - whether it continues to serve as a distribution channel for our content, or maybe for some unrelated future product or service (or as an advertising route for someone else&#8217;s product or service). </p><p>But we know that each of those routes opens up only if we continue to put in the work, only if we maintain quality over a long enough time period. </p><p>For most of the last three years, it&#8217;s felt like we&#8217;ve had a newsletter. Now it feels like we have a brand. Or at least the start of one.</p><p>Piece by piece we&#8217;re iterating our way to figuring out what Tigerfeathers can be, getting closer to finding the angel in the marble.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://tigerfeathers.substack.com/p/excavating-a-brand?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://tigerfeathers.substack.com/p/excavating-a-brand?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p>
