Language doesn't always work because not all Roma speak the same languages or even the same Sanskrit derived language. For various historical reasons my family only spoke Hungarian.&nbsp; It sounds a bit much but we had too many people wanting to join to add credibility to their wiccan side business or because they wanted to spice up their fanfiction about werewolves.</p></blockquote><p>More at the link. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/1b98d11/how_should_we_think_about_race_and_lived/ktur2tm/">The rest of the thread</a> on Roma and (vs?) other caravan-using peoples is fascinating too.</p><p><strong>3: </strong>Is your life too easy? Do you ever sit in your garden, enjoying the fresh air, thinking &#8220;man, I hate this, if only I was forced to defend a massive attack surface full of uncooperative weirdos, against bad-faith attacks by powerful institutions, while a peanut gallery nitpicks every single word I say&#8221;? You&#8217;re in luck - the Center for Effective Altruism has asked me to signal-boost that they&#8217;re <a href="https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/careers/head-of-communications">looking for a new head of communications</a>.
