<p>&#8220;Try harder,&#8221; you tell yourself, assuming that this directive will be taken seriously by the person you are five minutes from now. However, it&#8217;s not&#8212;that future person has no interest in the present you, who is, to them, a barely recognizable figure from a distant past.&nbsp;</p><p>&#8220;Try harder,&#8221; you tell yourself, assuming that the process that feels effortful is the one that creates results. However, it&#8217;s not, in this case&#8212;the feeling of effort is being created by superfluous action. You are furrowing your brow more vigorously in order to think better thoughts.</p><p>&#8220;Try harder,&#8221; you tell yourself, as a way of dissuading yourself from doing something you&#8217;re afraid of doing by making it more unpleasant. &nbsp;</p><p>&#8220;Try harder,&#8221; you tell yourself, narrowing your focus and failing to notice that you&#8217;re not doing something much more important.&nbsp;</p><p>&#8220;Try harder,&#8221; you tell yourself, because you feel like you don&#8217;t deserve a reward unless you have done something that, to an outside observer, would look like difficult work. For some reason, you feel that it&#8217;s cheating to produce something of value with ease, especially if you&#8217;re rewarded for it.&nbsp;</p><p>&#8220;Try harder,&#8221; you tell yourself, cleverly avoiding the things that you&#8217;re naturally good at, which come easy, in favor of the things you&#8217;re naturally bad at, which are hard.</p><p>&#8220;Try harder,&#8221; you tell yourself, assuming that you&#8217;re perfecting the thing you&#8217;re working on, rather than overworking it, ruining its natural charm.&nbsp;</p><p>&#8220;Try harder,&#8221; you tell yourself, neglecting the elegant solution that could&#8217;ve come from an earnest attempt to be lazy.&nbsp;</p><p>&#8220;Try harder,&#8221; you tell yourself, wringing some diminishing returns out of the existing mediocre process, instead of finding another better process.</p><p>&#8220;Try harder,&#8221; you tell yourself, in an attempt to act like you&#8217;re motivated to do the task in front of you, when, actually, you are guilty about not really caring about it at all, and it&#8217;s easier to yell at yourself than admit this inconvenient feeling.</p><p>&#8220;Try harder,&#8221; you tell yourself, because you&#8217;d rather not admit that you should instead seek help from someone who&#8217;s better than you at doing this thing.
