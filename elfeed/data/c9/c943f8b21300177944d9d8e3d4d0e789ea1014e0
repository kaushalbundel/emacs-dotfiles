<p><strong>TLDR: WATCH THE VIDEO (click above)</strong></p><p>Often when a familiar product launches a new feature, it falls under our radar. It takes something unique to get us to notice, and sometimes it&#8217;s less about the thing than about how we encounter it. This was the case for me with <strong>Zoom's new AI feature set</strong>. &#9757;&#65039;</p><p>How did it first catch my eye? An invite from a member of my team to &#8216;Activate the AI Companion.&#8217; This wasn't just another marketing email&#8212;it was my colleague asking me to do something. Now, if a suggestion comes from someone I know, I&#8217;m <strong>more likely to notice</strong> (and follow) it. This is called the <strong>messenger effect</strong>. David Attenborough whispering in my ear about a new nature doc? Sure, I&#8217;ll watch the Discovery Channel. &#128060;</p><h2>PLG + BeSci = Eyeballs &#128064;</h2><p>PMs call this approach '<strong>product-led growth</strong>', a.k.a. when the product becomes its own sales team. &#128521; Also at play here is <strong>behavioral science</strong>, a.k.a. when you understand your user's psychology and nudge them towards prioritized actions. &#128073; Whatever you call it, it <strong>got my attention</strong>.</p><p>But in some ways, this is where the genius ended. &#128543; Diving into the AI settings revealed a <strong>suite of features</strong>, but not all held equal weight.&nbsp;</p><p>Take the &#8216;Meeting Summary&#8217;, for instance. It&#8217;s&#8230; OK. What really stands out? The &#8216;<strong>Next Steps</strong>&#8217; section, which recaps the meeting's action items. Why? According to the Jobs To Be Done (JBTD) model, the user&#8217;s &#8216;job&#8217; is to get their work done effectively every day. Zoom plays a massive role in this. No one likes having lots of meetings, but in most companies we have multiple a day. This is the nature of a workplace.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://kristenberman.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://kristenberman.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><h2>If &#8216;AI&#8217; Stood for &#8216;Action Items&#8217; &#129300;</h2><p>Zoom could use those Next Steps and do more to <strong>increase meeting effectiveness</strong>. Productive meetings are about decisions and actions, not chit-chat.&nbsp; Given this, Zoom&#8217;s next obvious product step should be to <strong>complete their AI workflow </strong>and draft an email in the organizer's inbox, addressed to everyone who attended, with the meeting <strong>action items</strong>.&nbsp; This would: 1&#65039;&#8419; make the organizer&#8217;s job easier and 2&#65039;&#8419; help all the meetings&#8217; participants <em>get shit done.</em></p><p><strong>&#128073; 3 things I cover in this teardown:</strong></p><p>&#9989; How to use <strong>social norms</strong> to decrease the uncertainty of enabling a new feature</p><p>&#9989; Why the best features don&#8217;t just do the thing, but also the thing&#8217;s <strong>logical conclusion</strong></p><p>&#9989; How <strong>giving users options</strong> could increase adoption for B2B users&nbsp;</p><p>And now excuse me, because I have a <strong>job to do</strong>: next week&#8217;s teardown! &#128516; See you then. &#128075; </p><div class="native-video-embed" data-component-name="VideoPlaceholder" data-attrs="{&quot;mediaUploadId&quot;:&quot;8800faca-1909-4a7d-8412-202aa8cb786a&quot;,&quot;duration&quot;:null}"></div><p><em><strong>Have a friend who would enjoy these teardowns?
