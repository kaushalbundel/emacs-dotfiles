<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">There is no perfect policy; there is no solution that will once and for all solve a problem <em>unproblematically.</em> This is to say: no solution, however good, will not open up more problems. And oftentimes our circumstance is worse than that, for while moving from worse to better problems is a virtue and indeed one of the joys of life - a beginning of infinite progress - there can be occasions where purported solutions turn out to be anything other than genuine. Some (so-called!) "solutions" exacerbate our circumstance: they actively make things worse. We cannot know ahead of time how things might fail or succeed. All we can rely upon at any moment are our best explanations and those can always be improved.<br /><br />It is for this reason, that in the area of politics, our system cannot be designed to install the optimal solution or the best solution or the solution that will once and for all solve our problem(s). The world simply does not bend to the hopes of some that once the best policies are enacted that finally then, there will be relief from needing to continue to strive for something ever better or, in many cases, to undo an attempt to improve things that turned out only to make things all the worse. But people can and do become ideologically wedded to particular policies even in the face of failure and so this is why we need a system for removing those failed policies and people in power so wedded to them.<br /><br />This is why democracy is about <strong><em>not</em></strong> installing the ideal or best leader who will do the thing that solves the crisis because <em>they can no more foresee the future than any of us</em>. They are guessing their way to a better future - but they, like we, are fallible. Their policies and plans imperfect and the world changes around them anyways in ways they could not have foreseen with political culture such that &ldquo;changing ones mind&rdquo; when new evidence is found is a virtue and no vice. We should expect our politicians and their policies to fail just as we should expect our scientific theories to eventually fail. Politics, to a large degree, is still mired in a philosophy of being <em>deeply committed to one&rsquo;s beliefs</em> and for this reason punishes those who might try to adapt and change when the circumstances do. This is unreasonable. It is irrational. The eventual failure of any solution is the normal state of things and so being wedded to any particular solution is a recipe for disaster. We must always be willing to adapt, change our minds and perhaps on a dime turn around and go completely in the other direction. Or simply <em>change tac</em> so our progress can be far more rapid.<br /><br />Our political system is not for answering the question &ldquo;Who should rule?&rdquo; <strong><em>so the answer cannot be</em></strong> &ldquo;the most erudite; the most qualified, the educated and the experts&rdquo; - for they are just as fallible as the rest of us. Plato&rsquo;s mistake was not necessarily in thinking that philosopher kings were preferable to rule by the demos (the citizens) because the demos was a mob. It may very well be that <strong><em>the demos is a mob</em></strong> and should not rule over other minorities. It may very well be that philosopher kings would be preferable to rule by a rabble. <strong><em>Or it may be the opposite</em></strong>. It does not matter in either case because what Plato imagined <strong><em>was not democracy. </em></strong>And democracy is the only rational system for governing a group of people. So what is democracy?<br /><br />Democracy is not <em>rule by the demos.</em> That is not what it is. <strong>Democracy is a system for <em>removing the rulers without violence</em> when those rulers fail.</strong> Whether those rulers are &ldquo;the mob&rdquo; or &ldquo;philosopher kings&rdquo; does not matter. It does not matter if one of them claims to be &ldquo;a man of the people&rdquo; or &ldquo;the smartest person on Earth&rdquo; - they are part of a democratic system <em>if they can be removed from office without the use of force. </em>Votes are cast and they leave with the traditional <em>peaceful transfer of power.</em><br /><br /><em>In any modern democracy, </em>the mob does not rule anyway, though their representatives may. And once in power they might try to implement the policies of the mob. And those policies may succeed to <em>solve the problems that caused them to run for election in the first place</em> - in which case one presumes they will be re-elected. Or, of they fail, they will lose the election and be removed from office. And the self-designated &ldquo;best and brightest&rdquo; can try their hand at fixing things. And when they succeed or fail, the cycle continues.<br />But what no one can expect is an <strong><em>unproblematic</em></strong> state. Because even if the very best happens: even if your favoured candidate succeeds and your party wins an overwhelming majority and all of their policy platform enacted with very little delay - those solutions reveal new problems not able to be seen before. Obscured, as it were, by the detritus of problems right in front of your face and only once removed is your view now clear and you are able to see so much more. And besides, our universe is in flux and at any moment the unexpected and inherently unpredictable happens to undo all of your grand plans for finally setting up society in a way that is <em>better</em>. And the existing policies will fail to make things better - to solve the new problem at hand. And creativity will be needed, and thus new policies. And if the existing people in power lack new ideas then the purpose of democracy is to remove them. Guessing a new answer and checking it against reality. Iterating by error correcting. Because problems are inevitable. There is no way of installing the best candidate because "best" is always relative to a problem situation and different people have different problem situations.<br /><br />Civilization could well be regarded as the state of removing the initiation of force - of violence - from a society. It may well begin with knowledge - take no one&rsquo;s word for it. The removal of &ldquo;authorities&rdquo; when it comes to &ldquo;what one should endorse as true&rdquo;. We rightly recognise now that religious zealots beating children into submission until they can recite pages out of some holy book is the sign of an uncivilised society. Learning through violence does not work. We rightly recognise now that commissars and barons who would by decree divide up the labor of the peasant farmers by sending soldier backed tax collectors to take all of the grain and the cattle - is the sign of an uncivilised society that has no learned how <em>free</em> <em>trade</em> can benefit both the baron and the peasant. And democracy is where not the will of a tyrant is imposed <em>once and for all</em> upon the citizens not even <em>the will of the people</em> imposed once and for all upon the citizens. But rather leaders and policies are tried and tested and when they fail, just as in science, they are discarded as <em>not actually solving the problem after all. </em><br /><br />We are part of an ever improving civilisation. Our institutions are a recognition of the fact there can be no unproblematic state. <br />Our <strong><em>education system</em></strong>, ideally, does not use violence or coercion of any kind to inculturate and teach those who come new into it, the lessons those who went before us learned over millennia. Violence is anathema to learning.<br />Our <strong><em>methods of research</em></strong> - in science, technology, art, the humanities, academia and industry do not use violence to insist that their way is the best way. We try, we fail, we try again and improve. We know this enables the most rapid progress. Violence is anathema to discovery.<br />Our <strong><em>business and commerce</em></strong> is predicated on the assumption that providing a service is the way to provide value to the rest of society. No one is compelled to purchase your good or service. They can walk right out of the store or not renew the contract. Violence is anathema to trade.<br />Our <strong><em>democracy</em></strong> is predicated on the assumption that no one has all the answers and no policy can provide all the solutions. Any actual solution will reveal more problems and any ruler will, eventually, fail to offer up something as good as some alternative. So we have elections - the purpose of which is to remove peacefully, without force, bad policies and bad rulers. Violence is anathema to democracy.<br /><br /><strong>Becoming civilised is the state of gradually eliminating violence wherever it still lurks in our society</strong>. It is the incremental removal of <strong><u>authorities</u></strong> who can make and enforce rules or the adherence to ideas at every level in every place, where possible, and <em><u>where we know how</u></em> in such a way as to not make things catastrophically worse. (For example: eliminating police tomorrow in any major city would fail to make things better - the exact opposite). People are fallible and will not always be reasonable (including most especially people we are yet to encounter) and so a civilised society must also have at its disposal <em>the option to use force where necessary</em> and so it will need individuals especially highly trained in its use because a civilised society will not be civilised for long if it outsources all expertise in violence to the uncivilised - especially to vast uncivilised mobs.<br />&#8203;<br />But, as a rule, civilisation is where peace reigns.  Swords and guns exist but they are almost all of the time sheathed and holstered because the business of civilisation is to peacefully keep on trying to solve problems that have nothing to do with violence as rapidly as possible. Because problems are inevitable. Happily they are also soluble. <strong>As people that is our very purpose of life: to solve our problems today so that new and better and more fun problems can be solved tomorrow.</strong> Civilization is what allows us to continue to do that peacefully.<br />Forever. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />(Postscript: By the way so called &ldquo;direct democracy&rdquo; is <strong>not democracy</strong> either. It seeks to install, as a tyrant of a kind, <strong>the demos.</strong> Direct democracy is this idea that for any problem a particular set of policies are put forth (exactly by who and how, is another matter altogether) and then these are voted on by everyone. It has recently become popular with the advent of the internet and the real possibility of being ruled by some sort of technocratic voting system on&hellip;well anything people can think of presumably. But this is just to say: we can imagine a system where the majority can never be removed from power, by definition - because their votes on any given issue will always win the day and if you tend to disagree with their underlying philosophy the only thing for it is to leave that society or tolerate living subdued beneath it - for you cannot ever vote out those who rule over you and try out something different. Again: democracy, properly conceived, is the ability not to install any particular policy but to <strong><em>remove it. </em></strong>Minorities, outsiders and iconoclastic rebels need protection and representation too. A "direct democracy" is a direct path to their removal from a society and that would be the undoing of any such society because it is often those people who push genuine democracies forward.)</div>
