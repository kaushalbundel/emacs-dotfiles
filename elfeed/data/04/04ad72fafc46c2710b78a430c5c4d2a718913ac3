Depending how you looked at things, I started my retirement this past
Fall. Part of the plan was for Devorah and I to travel a bit more -
something we rarely got to do when we were younger. I did have a great
trip with Batya to Holland and Belgium but Devorah and I, other than a
couple of weekend getaways, weren&#39;t able to go anywhere. We planned to
finally have a trip in January but I broke a toe. Then there were a
few other niggling things that prevented getting away.</p>
<p>
Finally, this week, we made it - our first retirement trip, and
spanning our anniversary no less!!!</p>
<p>
We decided on Charleston South Carolina. Why? Well, why not. We wanted
to hit it in January since it would be somewhat warmer than NYC. We
figured that it wouldn&#39;t be too hot visiting now in early March - it
would be alike an early Spring for us. Besides, at least on paper,
Charleston checks a lot of our travel buttons - history, food, culture.</p>
<p>
Our first stop after flying in and lunch was <a href="https://southcarolinaparks.com/charles-towne-landing">Charles Towne Landing</a> - Charleston&#39;s
birthplace. Beautiful day, beautiful ground to walk around and our
first taste of Charleston history.</p>

From there to our hotel. Dinner was at a local place - <a href="https://www.ilovetheglassonion.com/">The Glass
Onion</a>. Really exceptional. We started with boudin balls then I had the
shrimp and grits and bread pudding for dessert. </p>

<p>
Devorah had the gumbo dinner. Super highly recommend. We might go back
tomorrow.</p>
<p>
We started today at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Sumter">Fort Sumter</a>. Obviously a lot of American Civil War
history but also earlier stuff and later. </p>

<p>
In the afternoon we went to the <a href="https://www.charlestonmuseum.org/">Charleson Museum</a> for lots of local
history. They also have a natural history exhibit with a giant sloth
that I&#39;m pretty sure is bigger than ours in Natural History:</p>

<p>
and also a quilting and abstract art exhibit.</p>
<p>
Then on the way to the City Market, we stopped at Peace Pie for a
snack.</p>

<p>
Nice place - custom ice cream / cookie sandwiches. Like Glass Onion,
also highly recommended.</p>
<p>
The City Market was pretty cool - lots of crafts</p>

<p>
Finally, before heading home, we checked out their U.S. Customs House. Nice
to contrast it to our Customs House on Bowling Green and it&#39;s
predecessor - Federal Hall. </p>

<p>
Overall a great day.</p>
<p>
The only two downers were when we passed a store with lots of anti
Biden T-shirts and also when we found out that the Civil War museum on
top of the City Market is run the Daughters of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Daughters_of_the_Confederacy">United Daughters of
the Confederacy</a>, fortunately, we decided to pass.</p>
<p>
For dinner, we got our South Carolina Barbecue at Swig and Swine:</p>
