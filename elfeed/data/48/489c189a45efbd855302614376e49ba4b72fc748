<p>There are writers and there are grifters. There are artists and there are content creators. Music is no exception: pop music all sound similar, using and reusing the same four-chord progression, while baroque compositions are made of tonal geometries no less intricate than the insides of a fine Swiss watch. Don&#8217;t get me wrong&#8212;pop music can be sensational. But, alas, sensation isn&#8217;t the same as beauty. This isn&#8217;t about highbrow versus lowbrow art, but rather algorithmic versus authentic creation.</p><p>Optimization tends to turn beauty ugly. Another term for optimization is &#8216;audience capture,&#8217; which is a strategic way of creating content so that the creation becomes a means to another end&#8212;fame, clout, money&#8212;rather than an end in itself. However, creative works cannot be deeply transformational for your audience if they are not meaningful to you first.</p><p>There is nothing wrong with wanting a big fanbase or making money with your talent. In fact, I&#8217;d argue that we all have this desire (as a writer, I definitely do). The problem arises when these things become goals in and of themselves. Artistry is the soul of creation, and over-engineering it for the sake of a certain outcome kills that soul. Capturing an audience should be a byproduct, not the objective. I dare say that idolizing email lists and follower counts is a form of blasphemy against your craft. And if you truly care about what you create, you&#8217;d be the first to know when your work has been betrayed.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theplurisociety.com/p/advice-for-creative-writers?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://www.theplurisociety.com/p/advice-for-creative-writers?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p>
