Now that I&#39;m back from my trip (and the subsequent cold that I&#39;ve
battled for the past few days), time to get back to &#34;work.&#34;</p>
<p>
About a month ago, my friend <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonmarkgo/">Jonathan Gottfied</a> interviewed me for his
<a href="https://deveducation.fm/e/r8krr96n-mike-zamansky">State of Developer Education</a> podcast. It&#39;s an hour plus dive into CS /
Tech education. It dropped when I was on the plane back to NY last
Thursday. I meant to write this on Friday but my cold took me out
until today.</p>
<p>
It was a thrill to be asked and fun to do - as you know, I love
talking shop. I&#39;ve known the host, Jon, for years, I think we met when
he was at Twilio. For the past almost decade though, Jon has been
building <a href="https://mlh.io/">Major League Hacking</a> - <strong>the</strong> organization to support
college hackathons. While I&#39;m not sold on the 30+ hours straight
format, a hackathon can be great tech extracurricular and MLH has done
so much to add structure and support for them. One of the things I
love about hackathons is that they&#39;re tech education adjacent and can
fill in missing pieces for students - networking with others, a social
activity, project creation, and outside personal learning. All great
things. Running an organization like MLH can also give people like Jon
a valuable &#34;outsiders&#34; view of what&#39;s coming out of the classroom. To
clarify, I say outsider to mean someone not employed as a teacher or
instructor. </p>

<p>For teachers who read this blog, I&#39;d recommend checking out the
podcast series in general. I&#39;ve listened to a bunch and found them
both interesting and valuable. Most of the episodes I&#39;ve listened to
are of professionals in the devrel space. Some come from traditional
CS backgrounds, some don&#39;t. As teachers, we can learn from their
perspectives and also gain insights into the professional tech
world beyond just being a traditional software engineer.</p>
<p>
So, I&#39;d encourage you all to check out the series here:</p>
