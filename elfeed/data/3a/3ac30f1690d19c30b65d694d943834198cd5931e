<p>
Last day of the trip we decided to take a day trip to The Hague. On
the way we passed through Haarlem</p>

For some reason I couldn&#39;t get this song out of my head</p>

<p>
We had some time to do some wandering</p>

<p>
and even stumbled upon their Chinatown:</p>

<p>
but the reason for the trip was the Escher museum</p>

<p>
Cool museum in a beautiful mansion.</p>

<p>
It had tons of Escher&#39;s work along with his story.</p>

<p>
I particularly liked that it had a lot of works that weren&#39;t the usual
tessellations and impossible figures but of course it had those as well.</p>

<p>
Getting back to Amsterdam we wandered around for a final time and
found their Chinatown as well</p>

<p>
Finally, we settled in to the hotel.</p>
<p>
We were supposed to come home today so we got to the airport nice and
early. No problem, at least until we boarded. Three hours later it was
determined that the plane had a bad part and they didn&#39;t have a
spare. Even if they did it would have taken a few hours to replace.</p>
<p>
So, we&#39;re spending another night in Amsterdam. Just at a hotel airport
so that&#39;s a little annoying. Not really the worst thing in the world
though. The hotel is fine, I&#39;m assuming dinner and breakfast here will
be as well and these things happen.</p>
<p>
I was just hoping to get back home to Devorah and Natan after two
weeks and Batya&#39;s probably sick of me already.</p>
