<p>In this ~40 minute video I discuss the myth of Procrustes and how it
relates to individuality, diversity, and collective human affairs.
Some of the themes I explore:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What is the myth of Procrustes and what we can learn from the
practice of applying one size to all.</li>
  <li>Do we want a world of uniformity or is diversity acceptable?</li>
  <li>How societies promote homogenisation and why there is a trade-off
between security and freedom.</li>
  <li>Freedom is limited in the state of nature and can be bestowed upon
us within structures that create predictable conditions.</li>
  <li>We are too quick to judge those who are not like us.  Perhaps we
need to learn how to withhold judgement and tolerate the diversity
all around us.</li>
</ul>
