While perusing Reddit this morning, waiting for the stuffing to bake,
I came across <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1819lan/does_anyone_know_more_about_what_happened_at/">this post</a>. Apparently there was a todo at Berkeley
involving a CS instructor. Specifically a grad student teaching their
data structures course.</p>
<p>
You can link from the first post to the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/180yq0g/thoughts/?share_id=SOixfq7Qa35iw-TwjBLi1">Berkeley subreddit post</a> and can
listen to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf63XKv77Mo">video</a> if you want.</p>
<p>
It seems that this was the last day of class and the instructor
decided to end class early, announce that he was going to share some
of his own views so students should feel free to leave and then
proceeded to give a very one sided diatribe on the Israel/Palestine
situation and to say one sided is me being nice. The instructor said
that his opinions were his own but also noted that this would be his
last chance to share them. He also made a small attempt to tie it back
to CS citing ethics issues albeit in a general sense and not tied in
to the class <a href="https://fa23.datastructur.es/index.html">syllabus</a>. </p>
<p>
This raises an important question. Should teachers bring politics
into their classrooms and if so, how and when.</p>
<p>
In my opinion, the instructor, in this case was extremely out of line
and I&#39;m not just saying this because my views on the issue are very
much on the other side to his. I am in general, very pro Israel and
believe that much of what we&#39;re seeing as pro-Palestinian PR is in
fact antisemitic. The test to me is one, will they call out the
barbarism of Hamas, two, will they acknowledge that Jews are also
indigenous to the region and have a right to a Jewish state, and
three, will they call out with equal vigor anti arab actions brought
on by non-Jewish actors. Usually, but not always, the protesters fail
on all three counts. I also feel that it&#39;s important for me to state
that I&#39;m very much against Israel&#39;s current right wing government and
many of their policies and they likewise need to be held accountable.</p>
<p>
Back to this Berkeley situation.</p>
<p>
In this case, the instructor was way out of line. Why?</p>
<ul>
<li>He&#39;s a CS PhD and has no actual expertise in the subject.</li>
<li>By ending class early, he used class time as well as his classroom
to share his political views. </li>
<li>Even though he said the class was over and students could leave an
instructor is in a position of power and students likely felt
pressure to stay.</li>
<li>Similarly, his words carry more weight as he&#39;s in a position of
power even though his words show only that he&#39;s been exposed to one
sides propaganda (note, that this means he hasn&#39;t heard either the
other side&#39;s propaganda nor factual nor history information). Of
course I could be wrong on this one but his words certainly sound
like I&#39;m right.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, if this wasn&#39;t on school time or property it might be a different
story. Similarly if this was really directly tied into a lesson it
might be different. Most importantly, if he presented all sides fairly
with factual information it might be different.</p>
<p>
Alas, it wasn&#39;t.</p>
<p>
If it were, though, it would still be tricky. I doubt I would have
shared my recent Israel/Palestine post or maybe even this one had I
not recently retired as it might influence the one or two stray
students who might happen upon this blog.</p>
<p>
It&#39;s also tricky because there aren&#39;t always two sides. I am of the
opinion, for instance that the current Republican party is a serious
threat to American democracy. There aren&#39;t two sides. There&#39;s no
equivalence between &#34;we want to raise minimum wage&#34; on one side and
&#34;we think LGBTQ people are a threat.&#34; Sorry. No two sides.</p>
<p>
Many issues, though are in fact nuanced even if the scales are weighted
more on one side than the other.</p>
<p>
The actual Israel/Palestine issue is one of those issues and in this
instance the instructor clearly overstepped their bounds.</p>
<p>
If I were to raise the issue in class (and I probably wouldn&#39;t given
what I teach) I&#39;d have to share historic context and resources from
both sides, share my biases, and perhaps bring in someone to present
the opposing side if I felt I couldn&#39;t be fair.</p>
<p>
While not politics, I&#39;ve always tried to take that stance on any
subjective issue I teach. Not as serious at all but when talking
coding style, I explain what I do, why I do it, what other people do
and why and then it&#39;s up to the students to decide.</p>
<p>
&#34;Non-CS&#34; issues certainly have their place in CS classes. We should be
talking about ethics and equity and that should be across all our
classes. We should also bring topical issues and other fields into our
classes when we can. When we do, though we have to be careful that
we&#39;re being teachers and not propagandists. </p>
