Since Austin, TX is in <a href="https://www.inthepathoftotality.org">the path of totality</a>, there are all kinds of events happening here. (So many people are expected to flood this area that <a href="https://www.kut.org/austin/2024-03-08/travis-county-to-declare-local-disaster-ahead-of-april-8-total-solar-eclipse">Travis Country has already declared the day a disaster</a>.) If the kids&#8217; school doesn&#8217;t get canceled, I plan on watching it with them, otherwise we&#8217;ll be on our street or in the backyard &#8212; one thing I learned during <a href="https://austinkleon.com/2023/10/18/eclipse-party-and-afterparty/">the last annular eclipse</a> is that I like seeing the eclipse in my everyday environment. (Related reading: artist <a href="https://kelzuki.com">Kelsey Oseid</a>&#8217;s lovely little book, <em><a href="https://geni.us/SiOx">Eclipse: Our Sky's Most Dazzling Phenomenon</a>. </em>Good for all ages.) <br><br></p></li><li><p>The 11-year-old wanted to stay up and watch <a href="https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/2024">The Oscars</a>, and I was glad he did because Ryan Gosling&#8217;s performance of &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhWqpvGq6b4">I&#8217;m Just Ken</a>&#8221;&nbsp;from <em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1517268/">Barbie</a></em> made me laugh and laugh. I don&#8217;t take the Academy Awards or any awards seriously, but I thought it was a good crop of Best Picture nominees this year. (This week Meg and I finally watched <em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14230458/">Poor Things</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13238346">Past Lives</a></em>, both of which I liked a ton.)<br><br></p></li><li><p>Runtime: My biggest quibble with movies these days is that every movie now seems to be 2 hours and 20 minutes long. If you, too, struggle with this, I highly recommend <a href="https://austinkleon.substack.com/p/intermissions">my &#8220;Intermission&#8221; method</a> of watching 1/2 a movie now and 1/2 a movie later.</p><p><br></p></li><li><p>New Pen: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/adam.koford/">Adam Koford</a> recommended <a href="https://geni.us/yyjA">the classic Pentel Sign Pen</a> and my whole family has gone nuts for them! I had to buy another box because they all disappeared.  </p><p><br></p></li><li><p>Sound machine: We live in an uninsulated bungalow a block away from a grocery store that gets early morning deliveries. We&#8217;ve slept for years with a sound machine going, but its hiss never really masked the sound of trucks idling. Then I slept in a hotel by a highway that had one of these <a href="https://geni.us/H2pOX">Douni White Noise Machines</a>. It has has a lot of low end and a fan setting that masks engine noise pretty well. Meg instantly ordered one for our bedroom and we&#8217;ve been sleeping a lot better since it arrived.<br><br></p></li><li><p>&#8220;I just play. I&#8217;m playful. And I became increasingly more playful with age.&#8221; <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/03/magazine/isabella-rossellini-interview.html?unlocked_article_code=1.ck0.a6qd.0ucig5tMr_JP&amp;smid=url-share">How to grow old like Isabella Rossellini</a>. <br><br></p></li><li><p>&#8221;Whatever style pants look like shit to you are the pants you&#8217;re supposed to wear, and as soon as they start to look normal to you, those are not the right pants anymore. <a href="https://twitter.com/NoahGarfinkel/status/1357424823371132928">You should always be wearing pants you think look stupid</a>.&#8221;&nbsp;I loved this article because I have literally stood at school pickup recently and wondered <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/03/magazine/big-pants-style.html">why pants are so big again</a>.</p><p><br></p></li><li><p>&#8220;I could never be friends with anybody who wasn&#8217;t curious and didn&#8217;t have a sense of humor.&#8221; RIP fashion legend <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2024/mar/03/iris-apfel-obituary">Iris Apfel</a>. I highly recommend <a href="https://tumblr.austinkleon.com/post/140278920631">Albert Maysles&#8217; documentary </a><em><a href="https://tumblr.austinkleon.com/post/140278920631">Iris</a></em>.  <br><br></p></li><li><p>RIP comedy legend <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/mar/04/richard-lewis-obituary">Richard Lewis</a>, who was born in the same hospital three days before <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/29/arts/television/richard-lewis-larry-david-curb-your-enthusiasm.html?unlocked_article_code=1.ck0.mKn9.Oh0Ee7NxXV-X&amp;smid=url-share">his best friend Larry David</a>. Their scenes in <em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0264235/">Curb Your Enthusiasm</a></em> are some of the show&#8217;s funniest. <br><br></p></li><li><p>Basic pleasantries: I am no saint, but I&#8217;ve been shocked lately by how saying &#8220;Hello,&#8221; &#8220;Please,&#8221; and &#8220;Thank you&#8221; to workers in service industries often elicits surprise and wonder and gets me treated like the Pope. I don&#8217;t know what is going on with most people, but it seems like a large number of us are becoming assholes, either downright mean or totally oblivious to others. I probably don&#8217;t need to tell you lovely subscribers this, but just in case: Try this week to acknowledge your fellow human beings and treat them with basic dignity and respect. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule">The Golden Rule</a> not only works wonders, it heals the soul!
