It took me several seconds to parse the casual quip &ldquo;But, aren&rsquo;t you folks web2?&rdquo;. I probed further and they continuedâ€”&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t Zerodha[1] web2? Why don&rsquo;t you convert it to web3?&rdquo;. For the next few minutes, I struggled to explain how technologies, processes, people, regulations, laws, industry, and the entire legal and societal foundation that underlie an organisation, no matter how imperfect, aren&rsquo;t &ldquo;web2&rdquo;, and that they can&rsquo;t just be converted to &ldquo;web3&rdquo;, whatever that meant.
