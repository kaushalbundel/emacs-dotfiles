<p>The following is an excerpt from my journal.</p>

<hr />

<p>One cannot be anonymous in a local community.  To be collocated at
peace with others requires mutual openness, which entails eponymity.
People know who you are, where you live, and, at the very least, have
a good sense of what you are doing.  This is very much unlike online
communities, where members can be anonymous and the knowledge they
disclose about themselves is mostly unverifiable.  For a local
community, anonymity is treated with suspicion, perhaps even fear:
“what is this indubitably shady person up to?” is a thought that will
naturally occur.</p>

<p>Eponymity engenders a sense of trust as the person is a known quantity
and their actions are traceable.  Each member’s identity is common
knowledge.  It thus forms part of the community’s shared narratives
and collective notion of selfhood.  Narratives are about who is who,
who does what, what happens where, and so on.  They concern the people
in the place, drawing linkages between the two magnitudes of community
and locality.</p>

<p>Much like individuals, collectives maintain a sense of identity, of
where their boundaries are, be they physical or notional.  Online
communities, for example, are centred around interests and identify
with them accordingly.  It is expected, for instance, that members of
the Emacs community come together to partake in their shared
enthusiasm for Emacs but not necessarily for agriculture: they can
distinguish themselves as separate from the farming aficionados, and
vice versa.  Distinctions of this sort have no malintent.  They are
not about excluding people or creating animosity.  Rather, they derive
from the basic capacity of humans to discern patterns, recognising
where something starts and where it ends on the cosmic continuum.
Local communities do have some shared interests, which typically are
the activities peculiar to the region, such as wine-making, though
they additionally develop their identity on the basis of their locus
and its enduring narratives.</p>

<p>To remain private in a local community is to forever be an alien to
it.  You will never gain anyone’s trust and good will as your story
will be unknown, not integrating into the shared narrative.  Eponymity
is the price to pay for membership.  The challenge, then, is how to
live peacefully with others, contribute to the commons, and still
preserve a sense of a private sphere.  This for me is especially
difficult, as my introverted nature predisposes me to be solitary and
to not seek company.  Yet I know that solitude will lead to my
marginalisation, which is unsafe for me long-term and potentially
unsettling for others in my midst.</p>

<p>I have found that I can enjoy people’s trust with my calm demeanour
and eagerness to help.  I do not need to join their festivals nor
attend church to pretend I am the same as them.  No!  It suffices to
keep the windows open so that others can take a peek.</p>

<p>The other day I was passing through the place of a distant neighbour.
My hut is outside the village, so calling this person a “neighbour” is
already stretching the meaning of the word.  At any rate, I was
invited for a coffee.  Even though I would rather not be there, I did
it for the greater good.  I find small talk incredibly dull, but I try
to make it interesting.</p>

<p>Sharing a coffee with a local is not about the drink per se.  It is a
ritual of sorts.  A rite of passage from stranger to acquaintance.
The person got to know me better.  I can expect that through the power
of gossip this knowledge is already spreading among others and each
such encounter will reverberate across the community.  To this end, I
am not surprised when someone I do not know greets me with “you live
down the river, right?”  They know.  And I have learnt that it is all
about keeping the windows open.</p>

<p>Being a member of the community means that you have the responsibility
to contribute to the common good.  At minimum, you must conduct
yourself with integrity and not violate the prevailing norms.  Rules
matter greatly, regardless of what we may think of them.  They cannot
be altered unilaterally and must thus be taken as immutable in
scenaria where only a single agent opposes them.  Norms are still
human in origin, hence mutable.  That they may appear sacrosanct is
due to their shared presence and affirmation in the minds of the
community’s members, who will act in a way that enforces the
substantive parts of the rule.  Norms form the basis of the
community’s identity.  To question them is to confront the community
as such, which will practically result in the marginalisation of the
offender.</p>

<p>The benefit of belonging to a community is that you get support from
volunteers who are eager to help without asking for anything in
return.  Each member of the community has a duty to do some public
service for the continued wellness of the commons.  Concretely, I was
at home the other day and was working on the computer.  A villager
drove by, parked the car in front of the hut, came to my room and told
me that they brought some construction materials that I could use to
seal off my walls for the coming winter.  I never asked for any of
this and did not tell this person about my needs (I must indeed
reinforce the construction and make all sorts of improvements, which
is apparent from the outside).  Yet it happened and I am thankful to
have received this kind of help.</p>

<p>Exchanges of this sort are not transactional.  I do not have to give
anything back to that person.  Instead, I must learn from their
example.  When I have the chance, I too will offer something to
someone who may be in need of it.  Perhaps I can train their dog, fix
their computer, provide a helping hand in some construction work…
It does not matter what it is.  The importance is to not be a strictly
private person in a milieu where anonymity is perceived as a threat.
Participate however you can, even a little bit, and be relaxed about
it.</p>

<p>My introverted self feels uneasy at the thought of some random fellow
villager walking in to my private space.  Not just for locals I have
never met, but even for individuals I know well.  Though in my
capacity as a rational agent I understand this is part of the deal of
joining a local community and of benefiting from the togetherness
involved.</p>
