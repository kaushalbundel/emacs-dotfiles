<p>We are excited to kick off this year’s search for two new team members to join us as part of our two-year Associate program. Here at Collab Fund, the first question we ask ourselves when evaluating a new investment opportunity is: If this startup becomes massively successful, will it make the world a better or more interesting place?</p>

<p><img src="https://collabfund.com/uploads/AssociateProgram.r2.png" alt="AssociateProgram.r2.png" /></p>

<p>We are focused on investing in businesses that are pushing the world forward, while also aiming to outpace the market and produce alpha returns over the next decade and beyond. To do this, we ask ourselves a second but vital question: Would a ‘villain’ invest in this company if their motive was one of pure self-interest? We call this <a href="https://collabfund.com/blog/the-villain-test/">the villain test</a>.</p>

<p>We believe that the greatest returns (financial and social) in venture often come from contrarian thinking and the best path to seeing things differently is by surrounding yourself with different and unique perspectives.</p>

<p>Our ideal candidates for the position include being:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Entrepreneurial</li>
  <li>Hard working</li>
  <li>Optimistic</li>
  <li>Intellectually curious</li>
  <li>Self-starting</li>
  <li>Excited to live in New York</li>
</ul>

<p>The Associates will work closely with our Partners and the entire Collab team on both sourcing and evaluating new investments as well as supporting existing portfolio companies.</p>

<p>In addition to offering all the things you’d expect (comprehensive and competitive compensation and benefits package including bonus, paid holiday leave, sick leave, health and dental insurance, team offsites, and 401k) we offer the opportunity to work at a firm constantly pushing the status quo. We have created a culture where we wake up feeling inspired and motivated to contribute fully everyday, not because we have to, but because we want to.</p>

<p>Here’s some additional miscellaneous stuff you may (or may not) care about:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Founded in 2010, our venture funds invest in early (pre-seed) through early growth stage (Series B and C) companies</li>
  <li>Our primary focus is investing at the early stages (seed+)</li>
  <li>We’ve also raised various thematic funds with specific mandates focused on areas including (i) <a href="https://collabfund.com/blog/collaborative-fund-and-sesame-workshop-launch-collabsesame/">kids</a>, (ii) <a href="https://collabfund.com/blog/consumer-startups-are-a-great-investment-heres-why/">consumer</a> and (iii) most recently, <a href="https://collabfund.com/blog/collab-sos-a-new-fund-and-a-call-to-action/">sustainability</a></li>
