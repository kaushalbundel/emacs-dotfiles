<p>It seems like everyone in the software industry goes through a blogging phase. This is the beginning of mine.</p>
<p>I have started this blog time and time again over the last three years. My original inspiration for having a technical blog came from one of my <a href="http://caseystella.com">mentors</a> at my internship. The continued inspiration is from people telling me that I sometimes make insightful comments.</p>
<p>This blog is not fully formed in my head yet, but I have some very broad topics that I want to address over time: data privacy, mental health, education, ethics, and life. I also intend to cover a smattering of technical topics. What I cover will certainly deviate from this, but it's somewhere to start.</p>
