<p><em>Happy Chinese New Year everyone! All the best for you and your family in the Year of the Tiger. Today's piece took longer than expected, but hopefully, you'll agree the topic is well worth it. Edit: <a href="https://lillianli.substack.com/p/the-chinese-tech-playbook-for-winning-845?s=w">Part II is here</a></em></p><p>A few questions for you:</p><ul><li><p>A micro-mobility startup is pitching your firm. They've raised up to $150m already in their seed and Series A and are now raising a $100m series B off a skyrocketing GMV. Does this represent too much capital raised already?</p></li><li><p>A startup is pitching to the investment committee, and they operate in a space that has seen a few sizable failures and no big winners historically. A partner with 20-plus years of investment experience tells the team that they've seen how this will play out, having invested in something very similar five years prior and lived to regret the decision. Would you still move forward with the investment?</p></li><li><p>A five-minute grocery delivery startup with locations in major Euoropean capitals announces their moat is their network effect. How do you assess this claim?</p></li></ul><p>The above were all real-life situations that I've experienced while working as a VC. My answers to these questions were coherent but fragmented. I had no great framework behind my thinking, just accumulated Medium thought pieces. But someone had a framework for these questions and used it to build a bona fide Chinese tech giant. Today I want to tell you about how Meituan's co-founder,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.caixinglobal.com/upload/wanghuiwen.pdf">Wang Huiwen</a>, sees the world.</p><p>It is an understatement to say Wang is a credible expert on startup growth. He was Wang Xin's constant co-founder, having gone through the success and failure of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renren">Xiaonei</a>&nbsp;and Taofang<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a> together before they finally hit it big with <a href="https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/meituan">Meituan</a>. He was there from inception to IPO, handing posts such as head of location-based services, ride-hailing, and R&amp;D. Meituan's reputation as the most battle-hardened tech giant whose management works with robot-level sangfroid is well earned. Despite being underdogs, they emerged victorious from the<a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Xb9wDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA46&amp;lpg=PA46&amp;dq=battle+of+the+thousand+Groupons&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=eKvGghbUzX&amp;sig=ACfU3U0T2CxaEBsngGtqI4tXzhcmZiyM-A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjXpZa_jPf1AhV-IDQIHdSmCOsQ6AF6BAgTEAM#v=onepage&amp;q=battle%20of%20the%20thousand%20Groupons&amp;f=false">&nbsp;battle of the thousand Groupons</a>&nbsp;through a combination of clear-headed thoughtfulness and ruthless efficiency. Since then, Meituan has expanded into various new business lines, including hotels, flights, cinema and other offline services. Wang's lectures indicate that while luck played its part in Meituan's eventual success, it was no accident.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/apps-social/article/3046907/meituan-dianping-co-founder-wang-huiwen-retire-amid-management">At the age of 41&nbsp;</a>in 2020, the billionaire retired. I'm about to summarise a series of lectures Wang gave on product management at Tsinghua University<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2" href="#footnote-2" target="_self">2</a> in Sep 2020.</p><p>I found the series insightful, so much so that I've since changed my framing of investment experiences (and if you were inclined to read the entire series, you can find the English translation at&nbsp;<a href="https://chinaplaybook.substack.com/">China Playbook</a>&nbsp;and the slightly different Chinese versions&nbsp;<a href="https://pxiaoer.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/e78e8be685a7e69687e6b885e58d8ee4baa7e59381e8afbe-e688aae6ada210e69c8830e697a5e59088e99b86.pdf">here</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pmcaff.com/profile/E7LX8eYrLd">here</a>). But I also found it slightly lacking in drawing the core linkages between concepts. So my summary is best classified as a remix &#8212; all the key elements from the original but reinterpreted.</p><p>Last caveat before we begin &#8212; Wang over-indexes on consumer technology given his Meituan background. His advice might be less applicable to enterprise software and other deep tech fields.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbc9f094c-30e2-4d02-8ddd-b9d3493f3635_858x946.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbc9f094c-30e2-4d02-8ddd-b9d3493f3635_858x946.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbc9f094c-30e2-4d02-8ddd-b9d3493f3635_858x946.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbc9f094c-30e2-4d02-8ddd-b9d3493f3635_858x946.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbc9f094c-30e2-4d02-8ddd-b9d3493f3635_858x946.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbc9f094c-30e2-4d02-8ddd-b9d3493f3635_858x946.png" width="244" height="269.02564102564105" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/bc9f094c-30e2-4d02-8ddd-b9d3493f3635_858x946.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:946,&quot;width&quot;:858,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:244,&quot;bytes&quot;:28386,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbc9f094c-30e2-4d02-8ddd-b9d3493f3635_858x946.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbc9f094c-30e2-4d02-8ddd-b9d3493f3635_858x946.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbc9f094c-30e2-4d02-8ddd-b9d3493f3635_858x946.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbc9f094c-30e2-4d02-8ddd-b9d3493f3635_858x946.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p><strong>How to find a winner</strong></p><p>Ask a typical western VC or founder about how to start a successful startup, aka winner (successful here being creating a billion-dollar-plus sized company), and you'll get a&nbsp;<a href="https://pmarchive.com/guide_to_startups_part4.html">variant of this answer</a>: Three components go into creating a successful startup: market, product and people. Find a big market and then the right product for the said market, aka product-market fit, and you'll be on your way. Of course, having the right people can get you to a good / great product and hopefully find the product-market fit faster, so that's why it's all about the people.</p><p>Different people will quibble about the relative importance of different groups, and some will make a case for Product&gt; Market&gt; People while others will argue for People &gt; Market &gt; Product.

With two core competencies 1)&nbsp;<em>the ability to discover opportunities, and 2) the ability to learn continuously. The remaining 90 per cent is luck.</em></p></li></ol><p>Or, put another way, are you the right person at the right place at the right time? While Wang doesn't comment too much on becoming a contrarian<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-4" href="#footnote-4" target="_self">4</a>, he does spend large sections on market and timing. So let's dive into it.</p><p><strong>Find a big market</strong></p><p>While it's easy to say that a big market is the first tenet of building a successful tech company, finding one is not without its challenges. Rarely do we find a viable market with no competitors in plain sight. In the age of advanced digital capitalism, we're either looking to enter existing markets or new ones. The most significant opportunities for companies theoretically exist in capturing new markets as they are created after catalytic changes in&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PEST_analysis">Political, Economic, Socio-cultural and Technological (PEST)</a>&nbsp;factors. These markets are developing, uncertain and often prone to underestimation.</p><p>The history of technology is littered with market size underestimation. They all arise due to an incorrect assessment of a market's needs during a given time window and the pace of market transformation. IBM's former CEO famously predicted that only five people in the world would need a PC.</p><p>Markets arise out of consumer and enterprise needs. However, commercial manifestations of needs are ever-changing, and the market's evolution moves alongside this. Current technology delivery often limits our ability to envision the full potential size of the market. Therefore, often people mistake the current Serviceable Addressable Market for eventual Total Addressable Market (TAM).&nbsp;</p><p><em>The food delivery industry in China started about 10 years ago, and it has 50-60M orders per day.

Some needs may be amplified by the changes in the social environment, wealth level, or human knowledge, etc.&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde668a39-7e47-4e76-a197-1cfad59f9047_2008x986.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde668a39-7e47-4e76-a197-1cfad59f9047_2008x986.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde668a39-7e47-4e76-a197-1cfad59f9047_2008x986.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde668a39-7e47-4e76-a197-1cfad59f9047_2008x986.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde668a39-7e47-4e76-a197-1cfad59f9047_2008x986.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde668a39-7e47-4e76-a197-1cfad59f9047_2008x986.png" width="1456" height="715" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/de668a39-7e47-4e76-a197-1cfad59f9047_2008x986.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:715,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:120153,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde668a39-7e47-4e76-a197-1cfad59f9047_2008x986.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde668a39-7e47-4e76-a197-1cfad59f9047_2008x986.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde668a39-7e47-4e76-a197-1cfad59f9047_2008x986.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde668a39-7e47-4e76-a197-1cfad59f9047_2008x986.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 "><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>A key takeaway is to know that TAM is always bigger than what we see today. Still, it requires a suitable business model and technology to make it commercially viable. Wang proposes that to understand the true size of certain TAMs, we should go back to the path of human development, which is the specialisation of labour focused on things we used to do ourselves. To spot the next big market, one must understand how specific needs will become more refined and prominent as people develop. Another indicator of an actual large TAM is if a business is operating profitably and growing fast, it must mean that the demand is super strong. There is an implicit but natural correlation between market size and growth rate.</p><p>This is clear to see from how Meituan arose. Wang and the team bet that people will come to see home cooking in the same vein as making one's clothes. It was a historical necessity, but as labour specialised and time became increasingly valuable, it will become a pastime indulged by a minority. This was not common wisdom when Meituan just got started. Wang was discouraged by the market cap of Grubhub, which only had a market cap of $3bn upon their IPO with 200k average daily orders. It was only looking at Ele.ma and their fast growth rates while staying profitable that the Meituan team knew they had something on their hands.</p><p>Knowing the total addressable market allows both founders and investors to judge the investment size needed to win the market. A large enough market is worth a large enough investment, and secondary to this, the proportion of investment should be related to the outcome. This throwaway remark is significant because VCs tend to consider investment figures in absolutes rather than as a relative proportion of the opportunity.&nbsp;</p>
