<p><strong>TLDR: WATCH THE VIDEO (click above)</strong></p><p>Ever grabbed a handful of M&amp;Ms just because they were right in front of you? &#127851; I have&#8212;so If I wanted to design a situation where someone ate minimum M&amp;Ms, I&#8217;d put the bowl <strong>really far from them</strong>. But maybe that&#8217;s because I come at the world from a behavioral economics POV. Ask an economist, and they&#8217;d come up with something very different&#8212;like the <strong>Fitbit screen</strong> I dissect in today&#8217;s teardown (spoiler: it doesn&#8217;t go well). &#128577;</p><h2>Economics vs. Behavioral Economics &#128202;</h2><p>The M&amp;M&#8217;s analogy gets to the heart of two <strong>very different POVS</strong>. Economics assumes people operate with stable, well-defined preferences and make rational choices. Behavioral economics, on the other hand, says that our choices are influenced, if not crafted, by our environment&#8212;be it social, emotional, or psychological. &#129504;</p><p>Using this lens, when you design a product with the traditional economics worldview, you aim to understand and cater to a user's fixed preferences. But in the behavioral economics realm, the belief is that preferences are created <strong>at the time of decision-making</strong>&#8212;thus products have an influence on shaping them.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://kristenberman.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://kristenberman.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><h2>Fitbit's Fail &#128078;</h2><p>What got me thinking about all this? I got a nudge from Fitbit: &#8216;Do you want to merge your Fitbit account with your Google account?&#8217; Traditional economics would argue that if I decline, it's due to a <strong>solid preference against merging</strong>. Behavioral economics, on the other hand, would ask if my choice was influenced by the <strong>design</strong> of the screen, the <strong>timing</strong> of the prompt, or any other <strong>external factors</strong>.</p><p>How would it look if Fitbit used the behavioral economics perspective? Maybe the merger prompt would be <strong>woven seamlessly into my user experience</strong>, making it feel like a natural next step. Or maybe the prompt would be <strong>tied to a specific feature</strong> that&#8217;s unlocked when I merge my accounts. &#128161;</p><h2>The Bigger Picture: Are Apps Truly Aligned with Users? &#129300;</h2><p>It&#8217;s just one little Fitbit screen. But it felt out of sync with my expectations and immediate needs as a user. The effect was jarring, and drove home <a href="https://irrationallabs.com/blog/move-over-product-manager-introducing-the-behavioral-product-manager/">an important point</a>: the way we approach our work as PMs and designers can <strong>deeply influence our users&#8217; interaction with it</strong>. So, are we merely laying out options or are we choreographing a digital journey? Are we designing from an economics POV, or siding with human behavior?</p><p><strong>&#128073; 3 things I cover in this teardown:</strong></p><p>&#9989; Where <strong>economics &amp; behavioral economics</strong> <strong>differ</strong> &amp; <strong>what this means for PMs<br></strong>&#9989; The importance<strong> </strong>of<strong> user context</strong> in shaping choices<br>&#9989; The power of <strong>nudges in decision-making</strong> through choice architecture design&nbsp;</p><p>Until next time, <strong>watch those M&amp;Ms</strong>! &#128516;</p><div class="native-video-embed" data-component-name="VideoPlaceholder" data-attrs="{&quot;mediaUploadId&quot;:&quot;307d2f32-69f7-4b31-9240-86218e5901dc&quot;,&quot;duration&quot;:null}"></div><p><em><strong>Have a friend who would enjoy these teardowns?
