<p>If you are ever going to start a company or work at a startup, do it now, while you are still young. I do not agree with the conventional wisdom that startups are for young people only, that once you get past a certain age it&rsquo;s all over &ndash; in my late thirties, with two kids, a dog, and an Audi, I better not. Helping start up and build companies is something I intend to do well into the afterlife.</p>
<p>But I do think the fact that I started my first entrepreneurial venture a few years before I was legal to drink (or had anything to lose) created the brain patterns and adaptations necessary to cope with the stress of starting and running a company. It was a bit like getting beat up the first day of school and losing all fear of bullies &ndash; it hurts, but you know what the worst is like.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot scarier (and more painful) to break the bones of your life when they&rsquo;ve hardened. Don&rsquo;t wait for calcification &ndash; if you think you are going to join a startup some day, just go for it.</p>
