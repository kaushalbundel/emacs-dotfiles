<p>We all have frenemies. They&#8217;re people who make you feel both good and bad, and they exist in every walk of life. You might have mixed feelings about a relative, a neighbor, a colleague, or a mentor.</p><p>My article in today&#8217;s NYT explores <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/28/opinion/frenemies-relationships-health.html">why frenemies may be hazardous to your health</a>.

I figured the most toxic ties would be with people who diminish you. But it&#8217;s even worse to rely on support from the very person who diminishes you.</p><p>My <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/28/opinion/frenemies-relationships-health.html">article</a> was about mostly why ambivalent relationships are problematic. The early questions from readers are about how to handle them.</p><p>Too often, we do nothing. We don&#8217;t like to admit having mixed feelings about people close to us, let alone talk about it. I think part of the problem is that Western cultures tend to <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article-abstract/28/4/636/1785527">sweep</a> ambivalence under the rug. We&#8217;re drawn to the linear simplicity of good or bad, and we struggle with the dialectical complexity of yin and yang. It&#8217;s hard for us to acknowledge that the same person can give to us and take from us. It&#8217;s even harder for us to accept that we can do that to others. So we bite our tongues and suffer in silence.</p><p>In my view, if a relationship is worth maintaining, it&#8217;s worth improving. And that&#8217;s not a job for you to do alone. It requires a conversation about what&#8217;s working and what&#8217;s not.</p><p>Ambivalent relationships are a two-way street. If you have mixed feelings, it&#8217;s not just due to their actions&#8212;it&#8217;s also due to your reactions. You&#8217;ve both contributed to the interaction, and it may be weighing on them too.</p><p>Fixing an ambivalent relationship requires the trust and respect to tell each other the truth. It&#8217;s better to embrace awkwardness for a shot at salvaging a relationship than avoid the discomfort and lose the relationship. In a healthy relationship, honesty isn&#8217;t a sign of disloyalty&#8212;it&#8217;s an expression of care. We don&#8217;t expect everything to be good, but we&#8217;re always striving to do better.</p><p>One reader said she was sending my article to a colleague and asking: &#8220;Is this us?&#8221;</p><p>We all get hurt by the people we love, and unpleasant interactions don&#8217;t mean we should walk away. Research suggests that on average, people tend to be happier staying in <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1467-8721.2007.00479.x?casa_token=DLIinkAL8z8AAAAA:vQMjrP80xAZcHSgz9CfsCWw3tW-TENsuMRoq9ezutlWM6OS43ehl7wIntvoFhXEzQsNyyJm3-Yh-">imperfect marriages</a> and <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2021-92336-001?casa_token=Q7PPHOS2RbgAAAAA:atFbTVO8-TrAkpkPmZwTYycvLn2MjK7GbwrQL68Xr2Zx06qKSUbGOm3SMVukjjp52v02HWLtP3QBhuBkfvGG7kQ">imperfect jobs</a> than abandoning them altogether.</p><p>If someone is abusive, though, it doesn&#8217;t matter how many positives they bring to the table. You're not obligated to maintain a tie with anyone who treats you poorly. Prior help is not an excuse for present harm. No friend, relative, or mentor deserves unconditional loyalty. You can appreciate someone&#8217;s role in your past without wanting them in your future.</p><p>In <em>The Godfather: Part II</em>, Michael Corleone advised, &#8220;Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer.&#8221; That advice doesn&#8217;t apply to frenemies. If it becomes impossible to turn them into true friends, it might be time to let them go.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://adamgrant.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://adamgrant.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p>
