<p><em>Iosevka Comfy</em> is a customised build of the <a href="https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka">Iosevka
typeface</a>, with a consistent
rounded style and overrides for almost all individual glyphs in both
roman (upright) and italic (slanted) variants.  Many font families are
available, covering a broad range of typographic weights.  The README
file in the git repository covers all the technicalities.</p>

<p>Below are the release notes.</p>

<hr />

<p>Update to Iosevka Comfy version 1.4.0</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>All fonts are now available in two more weights: medium and
semibold.  Use them to refine your interfaces.  This is in response to
the request for a medium weight made by madjxatw in issue 8 on the
GitHub mirror: <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/iosevka-comfy/issues/8">https://github.com/protesilaos/iosevka-comfy/issues/8</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Large portions of the build instructions have been rewritten to (i)
track the numerous and non-trivial breaking changes made by upstream
Iosevka and (ii) preserve the style of Iosevka Comfy.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The latin long S (ſ) and the Latin sharp S, else Eszett (ß), are now
supported by Iosevka Comfy.  Details of shape have been considered,
such that the reader does not conflate those characters with similar
ones (e.g. the sharp S with a Greek beta, an ampersand, or an 8).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The slanted version of the ampersand looks the same as its upright
counterpart.  This is a deviation from the previous version, where
this character looked like a flipped 3 with a flat top: I had
introduced that style by mistake and did not want to rebuild
everything just for it (rebuilding fonts is an expensive
operation—I spent 8 hours this time).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thanks to Raymond Ko for sending a patch to make Iosevka Comfy build
on top of Iosevka version 26.3.1.  I installed it to register the
contribution in Git, though I eventually wrote the aforementioned
changes from scratch as the current development of Iosevka has more
breaking changes.  It was easier to review all code points, than to
assume some as fixed.  Raymond send the patch on the mailing list:
<a href="https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/general-issues/patches/44816">https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/general-issues/patches/44816</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>As a note for future users, I am always keeping track of upstream
Iosevka, though I do not want to rebuild Iosevka Comfy too frequently.
Upstream has a policy of changing the code points practically every
few weeks, which then requires hours or days of testing on my end just
to keep Iosevka Comfy the same.  If you try to build Iosevka Comfy
from source, make sure to use the commit in iosevka.git specified in
my project’s README.md, as of this writing: this is the current
working version for me.  Future versions of iosevka.git will probably
contain breaking changes.  I will eventually adapt to them.</p>
