Johanna stays up for another three hours, researching and editing our essays, or working on her projects. Then, at five, I go straight from bed to the living room table where I read through her comments and write for three hours before breakfast.&nbsp;</p><p>These pre-dawn hours are my core work. On the days when I don&#8217;t go into the art gallery, I usually write for another few hours during the day. But that feels more like preparing the ground for the morning. It is the morning hours that keep me&nbsp;<em>inside</em>&nbsp;the work.</p><p>There is something hermetic and sealed off about the pre-dawn hours that appeals to me&#8212;the sky slowly shifting, the animals living up as night ends, the skylarks, the deers, the pheasants with their clapping wings. There is nothing human between me and the work.</p><p>When you have kids, especially when you raise them at home as we do, getting extended focus can be a challenge. When I did my main writing during the daytime, I would often mess up my routines if the 2-year-old changed her sleep pattern or some activity forced me to reschedule. This made me feel restless. I would end up writing after the kids fell asleep, sometimes typing from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/doestoevsky-as-lover">ten in the evening past midnight</a>. But if I have been busy with work, chores and parenting for 13 hours, I am not my deepest self. I slog. It feels better when I set off time before work, and before anyone else is awake. (The only drawback is that it makes me sleepy in the late afternoon.)&nbsp;</p><p>Writing essays is unlike any other work I do. It requires a deeper, more patient focus. It is not a <em>task</em> that I solve. Rather, it is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/being-patient-with-problems">a problem I sit with</a> until it solves <em>itself</em>. This means I often make no publishable progress for weeks; then I write ten pages in three hours. The erratic progress can be hard on the nerves.</p>
