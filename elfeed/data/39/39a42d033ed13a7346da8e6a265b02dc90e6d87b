Emacs 29  <a href="https://xenodium.com/emacs-29s-sqlite-mode">introduced the handy sqlite-mode</a>. Soon after, I tried a couple of experiments  <a href="https://xenodium.com/further-sqlite-mode-extensions/">here</a> and  <a href="https://xenodium.com/sqlite-mode-goodies">there</a> to bring additional functionality.
</p>

 <p>
Folks reached out. The additions seemed useful to them and were keen on upstreaming or pushing to MELPA. While I can't commit to upstreaming at this moment, I can happily meet halfway on MELPA.

While I haven't heard of issues, please continue treating the package as experimental and exercise safety with your data. Please back up.
