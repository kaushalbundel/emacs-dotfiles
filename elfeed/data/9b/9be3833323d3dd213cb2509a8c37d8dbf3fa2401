<p>Here is an entry from my journal.</p>

<hr />

<p>The power went off fifteen minutes ago.  I am done for the night.
Electricity will be generated again once the sun is out.  I was doing
important work on the computer.  All I can do now is benefit from the
laptop’s battery to produce this document.  I hope to type fast enough
before this one is depleted as well.</p>

<p>This is life off-grid.  You are forced to live within your means and
only spend what is available locally.  Today was a rainy day.  The
solar panels probably did not manage to recharge the batteries to
maximum capacity.  There is nothing I can do about it right now.
Maybe in the distant future I will add more batteries and/or
alternative power sources.  For the time being, this is my new normal.
The candle beside me and the moon above me.</p>

<p>In the past, I could not consider a scenario where I would have no
electricity supply, beside camping.  The grid is always there,
producing a seemingly infinite amount of energy.  From the uninformed
consumer’s perspective, it just works.  We do not recognise the costs
because they are hidden from our view: non-renewable energy sources
roll the burden over to the environment and future generations.  In
terms of social status, those who lead an affluent lifestyle with,
e.g., private jets and yachts, pass the cost to the lower parts of the
income distribution, as they can relocate to safer climates while the
rest of us struggle to find opportunities.  Same idea across nations:
the developed ones do it at the expense of all the rest.</p>

<p>I feel we are far away from the necessary concerted action on climate.
We not only need to change people to act mindfully, we must also undo
the structural inequalities between and within countries.  History
teaches us that when some party has to lose something and there is no
consensus over how to deal with the matter amicably, conflict shall
ensue.  We already have mass migration caused by climate change and I
doubt societies are ready to absorb millions upon millions, despite
the familiar palaver on tolerance and multiculturalism.  It is one
thing for the West to benefit from brain drain, where it cherry-picks
the migrants it needs, and another to take in people from all
backgrounds and have to do the hard yet essential work of integrating
them into the body politic.  Dumping foreigners in some area where
they can only form societies parallel to the local one will only lead
to more trouble over time.  Integration and the concomitant shared
sense of belonging is key.</p>

<p>Political problems cannot be solved unilaterally.  Though we have to
start somewhere and keep a sense of perspective as we push for at
least one minute change at a time.  This requires that each of us
becomes conscious of their spending patterns and the costs involved.
Science communicators have a vital role to perform in this regard, as
they can visualise this vague “carbon footprint” in terms that
everybody can relate to.  I knew about this concept for years, but
only now that I have to live with what I produce do I fully comprehend
the input/output dynamic at play.</p>

<p>We cannot “fix the climate” without changing anything in our daily
lives.  All of us will have to make do with less and the rich, be they
individuals or countries, must give up the portion of their wealth
that is now allowing them to parasitise over the rest of the planet
and its beings.  Will this happen?  Not without programmatic action
and continuous efforts.  These are easy for me to comment on, though I
know I cannot do anything, given my precarious condition—this too is
a matter of the prevailing institutional arrangements.  Even joining a
rally is a challenge unless, of course, they stop holding them in big
cities and move to the mountains for a change…</p>

<p>For practical reasons, I cannot collaborate with others to pursue some
political agenda, nor make them do the right thing.  All I can hope
for is that I at least learn from these findings and reforge my ethos
accordingly.  My woes teach me that once we are forced to deal with a
state of affairs, we have to adapt to it gracefully, such that we
preserve our vitality.  Yes, I would prefer to be able to finalise the
work I was doing on the computer.  I must earn an income somehow, even
if it comes with no job safety and I bear all the risks.  Though I
know I cannot act out of that wish in present time.  I then remain
sanguine and calm in the knowledge that no matter what I try right now
to restart the computer will be futile.  Instead of stressing about
what transpired and what is in store for me during the harsh mountain
winter, I drink fresh water and assess my immediate options.  I shall
go for a long walk in the morning and further consider what I have
gathered.</p>

<p>Remaining calm in the face of hardship is the most valuable skill I
have acquired and the most difficult to master.  I used to get
irritated quickly and lose my focus when things did not go my way.
Through continuous practice of tolerating inconvenience, of pushing
against the boundaries one small step at a time, I have learnt to be
patient and thus to not feel pressure as soon as something does not go
my way.  Stress makes us see things through a tunnel.  We do not
recognise opportunities, as we are trapped in a mode of thinking that
is not creative, not inquisitive, not daring.  Fears we have are
aggrandised and we find solace in the patterns we are familiar with;
patterns that may be part of the underlying problem to begin with.</p>

<p>To the untrained eye, calmness sometimes appears as lack of interest.
It is as if the person does not care at all and is immature to
understand the gravity of the situation.  Here, instead of “doing
something about it” I am blithely writing in my journal.  I do it in
full conscience of the matter at hand.  I do not have to worry about
appearing a certain way.  People who do not discern subtlety will be
quick to judge and to thus aggravate their own stress.  What are the
chances of finding someone who does not judge you but tries to
understand you, anyway?  A good rule of thumb is to not adopt
decisions under duress.  Have some water, open the windows to take in
much-needed fresh air, and go for a walk if you can.  Let yourself
disconnect from the source of the tension in order to revert to the
equilibrium and think things anew.</p>

<p>I will go to bed soon, with no angst, no disturbance.  I have learnt
to appreciate the little things.  To ask for few and to expect
nothing.  Why do we take what we have for granted and think we exert
full control over it?  This attitude only makes us suffer loses, as we
learn the truth of our impermanence one bit at a time.  Life is not
easy and we are not entitled to anything.  We must remember that no
matter what we accumulate, we own nothing.  The cosmos will rearrange
everything.  It is with aloofness, then, that I type these words.  The
rest shall wait until the morning.</p>
