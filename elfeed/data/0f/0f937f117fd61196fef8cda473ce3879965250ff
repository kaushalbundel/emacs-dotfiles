Here are some initial thoughts:</p><p></p><p><em><strong>Does one&#8217;s potential have a &#8220;shelf-life&#8221;?  -Inna</strong></em></p><p>Many experts have written about critical periods&#8212;windows of potential that close over time. A familiar example is language acquisition. Mastering new languages is known to get harder as we transition into adolescence and adulthood. That&#8217;s the bad news. But while researching the book, I discovered some good news about the so-called critical period. It&#8217;s not a hardwired feature of our biology&#8212; it&#8217;s a bug in our education (see chapter 1). Believing that potential has a short shelf life can stand in the way of growth.</p><p></p><p><em><strong>Hidden Potential implies that I have character strengths I've yet to develop, but sometimes I am exhausted by the idea that I have to continuously improve myself. How do I reconcile, or even untangle, the desire to improve from my relentless self criticism?  -Hannah Dye</strong></em></p><p>Skip to chapter 3. Something I should&#8217;ve said, but didn&#8217;t: Growth doesn&#8217;t always require you to criticize your weaknesses. It often comes from learning to harness your strengths. One of my favorite activities for leaders and students is the <a href="https://reflectedbestselfexercise.com/">Reflected Best Self Exercise</a>. You collect stories about times when you were at your best, and then compose a self-portrait based on the common themes.
