<p>In this ~20 minute video, I demonstrate the new optional features of
Denote to (i) link to Org headings while still using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote:</code>
link type, and (ii) extract a heading with its contents into a
standalone Denote note.</p>

<p>These features are part of the current development version.</p>

<h2>Denote</h2>

<p>Denote is a simple note-taking tool for Emacs.  It is based on the idea
that notes should follow a predictable and descriptive file-naming
scheme.  The file name must offer a clear indication of what the note is
about, without reference to any other metadata.  Denote basically
streamlines the creation of such files while providing facilities to
link between them.</p>

<p>Denote’s file-naming scheme is not limited to “notes”.  It can be used
for all types of file, including those that are not editable in Emacs,
such as videos.  Naming files in a consistent way makes their
filtering and retrieval considerably easier.  Denote provides relevant
facilities to rename files, regardless of file type.</p>
