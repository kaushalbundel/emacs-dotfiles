<p>Hey, folks! Thanks once again for being a paid Noahpinion subscriber &#8212; there are now 12,000 of you! I can&#8217;t tell you how grateful I am to have such a large audience &#8212; and, more importantly, an audience that&#8217;s so smart and engaged and fun.</p><p>Anyway, I try to do a subscriber survey about once a year, just to find out how I&#8217;m doing, and what people would like&#8230;</p>
